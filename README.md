genetic keyboard layout:
this is a basic script that, with help from chatg- i mean, visual studio code (totally) *reapropriated* from bprajeeth on github. The original project is called QWERTY, check it out (i dont have a link, sorry)

letter ranker:
this is some very basic python code that just asks for a file that has written text in it and ranks the letters in order from most common to least common, you could do this on any major database, i reccomend using it with the keylogger if you are trying to make your own keyboard

keylogger:
this is also some basic code that i managed to wrangle out of the neural network of.. my brain. it is meant to be used i conjunction with the letter ranker, it just saves what you type to a file called key_log.txt, then you use the letter ranker to find out what letter you typed the most is, then you can design your own keyboard. you could also use the genetic keyboard AI to generate a keyboard based entirely off of your logged text.

ps:
  good luck with your keyboard, i hope this helps
