Hello there, my name is Graeme. I write text in English and python. This is a random text file so that I can type the minimum distance for the maximum speed on my keyboard, so I will be using this text file by typing the most random shi- bullcrap in here. I am 14 (fourteen) years of age (old) and I enjoy coding, whittling, and reading random pieces of text. I have a girlfriend, and I enjoy texting her, because it makes me feel nice. I also enjoy playing the piano, as it makes a beautiful sound, and if you learn a nice song (like feed the machine) and then you can play it whenever you want. It also elicits a really nice feeling in you when you play a song by yourself, with your own two hands, playing completely different sounds in different orders, that come together to make some of the best sounding music you have ever heard, and people on the outside just don't understand it as well as you, the player on the inside. anyway, aside from my incoherent ramblings about music, I noticed that the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, every time, unless it doesn't. Normally by this point, I would ask 'how are you' and then promptly end the conversation because I have nothing else to talk about, but I'm playing dirty and I am turning that into a conversation point, so TAKE THAT DUMBAS- anyway :D. I really like python, there is so much you can do with it, and its very powerful for calculations and anything really math related. Speaking of math, I really enjoy it, there is an understandable complexity in math that makes sense while also not making sense. I am so deeply invested into this AI that my fingers are pretty much typing the fastest they ever have. I'm going to start talking about things that aren't me, instead, im going to talk about Marxist communism (the best kind). communism is the idea that personal property doesn't exist, everyone owns everything as a collective. Communism also states that everyone is equal, there is no difference between people, save their physical differences. a black politician is no different that a white server working in MacDonalds, save their skin color, which gives off light in different energies than each other, one absorbs more light than the other one, giving the appearance of darker skin. Because everyone is equal and everyone owns everything, there would be no difference between rich and poor, powerful and not powerful, as there wouldn't be anything to differentiate them from each other, again, except for physical differences between the rich man and poor man. As everyone owns all property, currency would be useless, as currency only works on the principle that someone who wants something that they don't own can pay for that thing with something that he owns, that the other one wants. If I wanted to buy a bag of wheat from you, I could exchange a certain amount of objects, say, a  cow, with your wheat, and then you own the cow that I used to own, and I own the wheat that you used to own. Some smart people, possibly hundreds of thousands of years prior, decided to make a common object that everyone wants that can be exchanged for anything. This is called currency, and it has evolved over time. In the past, people would exchange rocks with a hole in the center as currency, with the larger rocks being more valuable, or conch shells. Pretty recently, this has evolved into other objects that you may recognise, the US dollar, the euro, the Chinese yen, etcetera (etc.). There is a problem with this form of exchange, named capitalism, and this is that the rich just get richer, while the poor get poorer. Granted, in recent years, the game of capitalism has gotten more complex, shares being right at the top of the list of reasons, but that is besides the point. The point is that the poor work for rich people, and make money, but the rich make far more money off the back of poor people. If you have ever come home, and felt like you have been overworked, have achieved nothing in your life that you wanted to achieve, and have just made someone richer, that is because you have, and that feeling you get can be solved by a revolution. a communist revolution would be beneficial for all people, as there would only be motivation to do what you wanted to do in life, and not what the rich men want you to do, as there would be no rich men. Think about the amount of things you could do with that. you might start that out with renovating your house, however you wanted to, for absolutely free. or maybe you would invest in a better computer to play better videogames for FREE, or maybe you would host those videogames as a passion project, or you could take up farming, or music, or literally anything you want, for free. now that my rambling about communism is done, im going to paste some python code in here. here is the python code:

import random

# Keyboard layout
layout = ["qwertyuiop", "asdfghjkl;", "zxcvbnm,.?"]

# Population size
POPULATION_SIZE = 100

# Probability of mutation
MUTATION_RATE = 0.01

        child = parent1[:crossover_point] + parent2[crossover_point:]

        # Mutate the child with a small probability
        if random.random() < MUTATION_RATE:

            col_index = random.randint(0, len(layout[row_index]) - 1)
            child[row_index] = (
                child[row_index][:col_index]
                + chr(random.randint(97, 122))
                + child[row_index][col_index + 1 :]
            )

        # Add the child to the new population
        new_population.append(child)
        # Set the current population to the new population

population = new_population
# Get the best layout from the final population
best_layout = min(population, key=fitness)

# Print the best layout
print("The new efficient keyboard layout\n\n")
for i in range(len(best_layout)):
    print("  " * i, end="")
    for j in best_layout[i]:
        val = j + "  "
        print(val, end="")
    print()

f.write(f"const keyboard = '{keyb}';\n")
f2 = open("index.txt", "r")
content = f2.read()
f2.close()
f.write(content)
f.close()

anyway, now that the pycode is in, how are you, im going to promptly end this conversation in 3, 2, *gives hug*, 1

nevermind, im back with text from my discord channels
nobara lived a life where all she knew was saying goodbye. she said goodbye to saori, fumi, her 'hometown' yuji, and eventually everything. and yet she still founud it in herself to find all the good in her life. to think about and appreciate the people who forced their ways into the seats of her life, in the scene before her life was taken. she was so full of love for everything and everyone around her no matter the circumstances. to think whenever we see yuji remember her she's always smiling and so happy she was so full of life and love. her motivations were always her friends and those who affected her in her life to make her into the woman she was.she only lived 16 years but was still able to say life wasn't so bad. she left everything behind for a new life in the city to do the thing she loves most (and to have an experience lol), just to for it to be the reason she dies and to lose it there. nobara was so authentically herself in every aspect. she loved dressing up (even asking for a modelling career very early in the series) and being pretty, being strong, and most importantly she loved being herself. she's a strong and confident in her ways and will use those strengths to fight for the people she loves. she would run into danger when she could've left and saved herself in order to protect others. she always wants to stay true to herself and help others. shes such a liveable character, im hoping chapter 265 wasn't a confirmation (even tho its kind of obvious, or im js delusional) and hopefull, get to see her again. even if we havent gotten any confirmation since around like chapter 130 (?) i feel like her story wasn't complete as she was just beginning to understand her cursed technique. even one possible appearence. although her life ended early, she still had to keep her promise to fumi, to return to meet her again. and she had her whole life ahead of her.

Hi. I started my bug hunting journey and selected a website to hunt. I just found that after removing the s from https, the site still loads. Is it a valid bug? should I report it? If yes what will be it's severity level?
Kindly guide me please
>ch cybersec
Henry — 01/08/2024 23:25
If the url actually says (and stays) at http then probably. If you type http normally you should be dedirected to https 
Your browser should also warn you that the site is insecure

that didn't work quite like i planned, but hey, here is the longest single peice of text in the world:
Hello, everyone! This is the LONGEST TEXT EVER! I was inspired by the various other "longest texts ever" on the internet, and I wanted to make my own. So here it is! This is going to be a WORLD RECORD! This is actually my third attempt at doing this. The first time, I didn't save it. The second time, the Neocities editor crashed. Now I'm writing this in Notepad, then copying it into the Neocities editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocities editor to avoid crashing. It sucks that my past two attempts are gone now. Those actually got pretty long. Not the longest, but still pretty long. I hope this one won't get lost somehow. Anyways, let's talk about WAFFLES! I like waffles. Waffles are cool. Waffles is a funny word. There's a Teen Titans Go episode called "Waffles" where the word "Waffles" is said a hundred-something times. It's pretty annoying. There's also a Teen Titans Go episode about Pig Latin. Don't know what Pig Latin is? It's a language where you take all the consonants before the first vowel, move them to the end, and add '-ay' to the end. If the word begins with a vowel, you just add '-way' to the end. For example, "Waffles" becomes "Afflesway". I've been speaking Pig Latin fluently since the fourth grade, so it surprised me when I saw the episode for the first time. I speak Pig Latin with my sister sometimes. It's pretty fun. I like speaking it in public so that everyone around us gets confused. That's never actually happened before, but if it ever does, 'twill be pretty funny. By the way, "'twill" is a word I invented recently, and it's a contraction of "it will". I really hope it gains popularity in the near future, because "'twill" is WAY more fun than saying "it'll". "It'll" is too boring. Nobody likes boring. This is nowhere near being the longest text ever, but eventually it will be! I might still be writing this a decade later, who knows? But right now, it's not very long. But I'll just keep writing until it is the longest! Have you ever heard the song "Dau Dau" by Awesome Scampis? It's an amazing song. Look it up on YouTube! I play that song all the time around my sister! It drives her crazy, and I love it. Another way I like driving my sister crazy is by speaking my own made up language to her. She hates the languages I make! The only language that we both speak besides English is Pig Latin. I think you already knew that. Whatever. I think I'm gonna go for now. Bye! Hi, I'm back now. I'm gonna contribute more to this soon-to-be giant wall of text. I just realised I have a giant stuffed frog on my bed. I forgot his name. I'm pretty sure it was something stupid though. I think it was "FROG" in Morse Code or something. Morse Code is cool. I know a bit of it, but I'm not very good at it. I'm also not very good at French. I barely know anything in French, and my pronunciation probably sucks. But I'm learning it, at least. I'm also learning Esperanto. It's this language that was made up by some guy a long time ago to be the "universal language". A lot of people speak it. I am such a language nerd. Half of this text is probably gonna be about languages. But hey, as long as it's long! Ha, get it? As LONG as it's LONG? I'm so funny, right? No, I'm not. I should probably get some sleep. Goodnight! Hello, I'm back again. I basically have only two interests nowadays: languages and furries. What? Oh, sorry, I thought you knew I was a furry. Haha, oops. Anyway, yeah, I'm a furry, but since I'm a young furry, I can't really do as much as I would like to do in the fandom. When I'm older, I would like to have a fursuit, go to furry conventions, all that stuff. But for now I can only dream of that. Sorry you had to deal with me talking about furries, but I'm honestly very desperate for this to be the longest text ever. Last night I was watching nothing but fursuit unboxings. I think I need help. This one time, me and my mom were going to go to a furry Christmas party, but we didn't end up going because of the fact that there was alcohol on the premises, and that she didn't wanna have to be a mom dragging her son through a crowd of furries. Both of those reasons were understandable. Okay, hopefully I won't have to talk about furries anymore. I don't care if you're a furry reading this right now, I just don't wanna have to torture everyone else. I will no longer say the F word throughout the rest of this entire text. Of course, by the F word, I mean the one that I just used six times, not the one that you're probably thinking of which I have not used throughout this entire text. I just realised that next year will be 2020. That's crazy! It just feels so futuristic! It's also crazy that the 2010s decade is almost over. That decade brought be a lot of memories. In fact, it brought be almost all of my memories. It'll be sad to see it go. I'm gonna work on a series of video lessons for Toki Pona. I'll expain what Toki Pona is after I come back. Bye! I'm back now, and I decided not to do it on Toki Pona, since many other people have done Toki Pona video lessons already. I decided to do it on Viesa, my English code. Now, I shall explain what Toki Pona is. Toki Pona is a minimalist constructed language that has only ~120 words! That means you can learn it very quickly. I reccomend you learn it! It's pretty fun and easy! Anyway, yeah, I might finish my video about Viesa later. But for now, I'm gonna add more to this giant wall of text, because I want it to be the longest! It would be pretty cool to have a world record for the longest text ever. Not sure how famous I'll get from it, but it'll be cool nonetheless. Nonetheless. That's an interesting word. It's a combination of three entire words. That's pretty neat. Also, remember when I said that I said the F word six times throughout this text? I actually messed up there. I actually said it ten times (including the plural form). I'm such a liar! I struggled to spell the word "liar" there. I tried spelling it "lyer", then "lier". Then I remembered that it's "liar". At least I'm better at spelling than my sister. She's younger than me, so I guess it's understandable. "Understandable" is a pretty long word. Hey, I wonder what the most common word I've used so far in this text is. I checked, and appearantly it's "I", with 59 uses! The word "I" makes up 5% of the words this text! I would've thought "the" would be the most common, but "the" is only the second most used word, with 43 uses. "It" is the third most common, followed by "a" and "to". Congrats to those five words! If you're wondering what the least common word is, well, it's actually a tie between a bunch of words that are only used once, and I don't wanna have to list them all here. Remember when I talked about waffles near the beginning of this text? Well, I just put some waffles in the toaster, and I got reminded of the very beginnings of this longest text ever. Okay, that was literally yesterday, but I don't care. You can't see me right now, but I'm typing with my nose! Okay, I was not able to type the exclamation point with just my nose. I had to use my finger. But still, I typed all of that sentence with my nose! I'm not typing with my nose right now, because it takes too long, and I wanna get this text as long as possible quickly. I'm gonna take a break for now! Bye! Hi, I'm back again. My sister is beside me, watching me write in this endless wall of text. My sister has a new thing where she just says the word "poop" nonstop. I don't really like it. She also eats her own boogers. I'm not joking. She's gross like that. Also, remember when I said I put waffles in the toaster? Well, I forgot about those and I only ate them just now. Now my sister is just saying random numbers. Now she's saying that they're not random, they're the numbers being displayed on the microwave. Still, I don't know why she's doing that. Now she's making annoying clicking noises. Now she's saying that she's gonna watch Friends on three different devices. Why!?!?! Hi its me his sister. I'd like to say that all of that is not true. Max wants to make his own video but i wont let him because i need my phone for my alarm.POOP POOP POOP POOP LOL IM FUNNY. kjnbhhisdnhidfhdfhjsdjksdnjhdfhdfghdfghdfbhdfbcbhnidjsduhchyduhyduhdhcduhduhdcdhcdhjdnjdnhjsdjxnj Hey, I'm back. Sorry about my sister. I had to seize control of the LTE from her because she was doing keymash. Keymash is just effortless. She just went back to school. She comes home from school for her lunch break. I think I'm gonna go again. Bye! Hello, I'm back. Let's compare LTE's. This one is only 8593 characters long so far. Kenneth Iman's LTE is 21425 characters long. The Flaming-Chicken LTE (the original) is a whopping 203941 characters long! I think I'll be able to surpass Kenneth Iman's not long from now. But my goal is to surpass the Flaming-Chicken LTE. Actually, I just figured out that there's an LTE longer than the Flaming-Chicken LTE. It's Hermnerps LTE, which is only slightly longer than the Flaming-Chicken LTE, at 230634 characters. My goal is to surpass THAT. Then I'll be the world record holder, I think. But I'll still be writing this even after I achieve the world record, of course. One time, I printed an entire copy of the Bee Movie script for no reason.It'll feel nice to be way ahead the record. My sister's alarm clock has been going off for half an hour and I haven't turned it off. Why? Because LAZYNESS! Actually, I really should turn it off now. There, I turned it off. First when I tried to turn it off, it started playing the radio. Then I tried again, and it turned off completely. Then I hurt myself on the door while walking out. So that was quite the adventure. I'm gonna go sleep now. Goodnight! Hey, I'm back again. My computer BSOD'd while writing this, so I have to start this section over again. That's why you save your work, kids! Before I had to start over again, I was talking about languages. Yes, I decided to bring that topic back after a while. But I no longer want to talk about it. Why? Because it'll probably bore you to death. That is assuming you're reading this at all. Who knows, maybe absolutely zero people will read this within the span of the universe's existence. But I doubt that. There's gotta be someone who'll find this text and dedicate their time to reading it, even if it takes thousands of years for that to happen. What will happen to this LTE in a thousand years? Will the entire internet dissapear within that time? In that case, will this text dissapear with it? Or will it, along with the rest of what used to be the internet, be preserved somewhere? I'm thinking out loud right now. Well, not really "out loud" because I'm typing this, and you can't technically be loud through text. THE CLOSEST THING IS TYPING IN ALL CAPS. Imagine if I typed this entire text like that. That would be painful. I decided to actually save my work this time, in case of another crash. I already had my two past attempts at an LTE vanish from existance. I mean, most of this LTE is already stored on Neocities, so I probably won't need to worry about anything. I think I might change the LTE page a little. I want the actual text area to be larger. I'm gonna make it a very basic HTML page with just a header and text. Maybe with some CSS coloring. I don't know. Screw it, I'm gonna do it. There, now the text area is larger. It really does show how small this LTE is so far compared to FlamingChicken or Hermnerps. But at least I made the background a nice Alice Blue. That's the name of the CSS color I used. It's pretty light. We're getting pretty close to the 1/10 mark! That's the point where we're one tenth of the way to making this the longest text ever, meaning all I have to do is write the equivalent of everything I've already written so far nine more times! Not gonna make any promises, though. How come every time I try to type "though", it comes out as "thought"? Why do I always type the extra T? It's so annoying that I have to delete the T every time. Okay, only mildly annoying. Not as annoying as I previously described. I apologize for my exaggeration of the annoyance level of me typing "thought" instead of "though". I just realized that most of the games I play are games that I've been playing for at least six years. I started playing Garry's Mod in 2013, Minecraft in whatever year version 1.2.3 came out. Now I have to look that up. March 2, 2012. So I started playing Minecraft approximately during that time. Wow, seven years ago! Coincidentally, I was also seven years old then. I remember the days of 2012-13. That was when I still played Roblox and made terrible YouTube videos. I was called "Infinite Budgets" back then. I also remember the days of 2016. A lot of people thought that was a terrible year, but for me personally, it brings me a lot of nostalgia because I talked a lot with my online friend at the time, and I did livestreams on YouTube and stuff. It was fun. 2016 was also when I got the phone that I still have to this day. Yup, my phone is three years old. My life was completely different when I got this phone: I was 11 years old, my YouTube channel actually had activity, and I wasn’t writing this text. I’m currently writing this in the car. We are on out way to the dollar store. And since I’m writing this on my phone, I’m making a lot more typos than usual. Some of them might make it through, so be prepared for that. Anyways, we appear to be getting close to the dollar store. I have a gift card for that place. I think so anyways, it might be for a different store... Yup, this dollar store is different. Oh well. My sister has an obsession with sponges. I’m sure she’s gonna find the sponges and go crazy over them. Why does she like sponges so much? No idea. She just found a bag of tiny baby dolls, and she wants to put them in ice cubes and call it “Ice Ice Baby”. She is truly a strange human being. My sister also has an obsession with stuffies. She has such an addiction, that she’s banned from them. Now she found the wigs and she’s considering buying one. She’s been looking at them for quite a while now. We’re out of the dollar store, and now we’re going to the computer store. I have no idea why we’re here. I guess we just are. Now we’re going home. Welp, that was a fun adventure. Stay tuned for more fun adventures as you read through this LTE. I should go now. Bye! Hello again. I made a private world on OurWorldOfText for my sister and I, but she doesn't want to join it. She doesn't think it'll be fun. Now I'm just editing it alone. How sad. But oh well. Now I’m here adding more to this text. I once made a Discord server specifically for a language called “Bo”, where the only word is “bo”. I made it almost four months ago, and somehow, it’s still going. People are still spamming nothing but “bo” there. It’s great. I also once made a server where you’re not allowed to use any vowels. It was a very strange server. I deleted it after some time though, so all that insanity is no more. I also used to own a Pig Latin server, but it got inactive so I deleted that too. We had some good memories in that server though. Now there’s a new Pig Latin server, but it’s not owned by me. Dang, my YouTube channel has been dead for so long. I haven’t posted a video in a year. I want to revive it, but I don’t know what to post there. I’ll figure it out. I doubt my channel will ever go back to it’s 2016 legacy, but I’m sure I’ll post something eventually. Random fact of the day: there are thirty-nine question marks so far in this text. Am I about to make it forty? Yes, I just did. Now the fact I initially stated is no longer true. Or is it? Because I said “so far” in the fact, that implies that we’re talking about the moment that fact was said, disregarding any future events. Now I’m pretty sure that fact is still technically true. Welp, I guess I should just accept that I’m editing that world of text alone for the rest of my life. I originally put a bunch of complaining in there, but I deleted it all. The thing is, now that world will never be same without all of that complaining about my sister not being here. But that’s fine. Hey, I just had a cool realization. Basically, there’s this conlang (constructed language, for those not in the know) server where we have a Sentence of the Week activity. In this activity, someone posts a text with a maximum of nine sentences, then people translate it into their own conlangs. My realization is this: if we take nine sentences from this LTE every week, there would be a whole year of sentences for people to translate. There are approximantly 523 sentences in this LTE. Divide that by 9 sentences each week, and you get 58 weeks worth of sentences, which is approximantly the number of weeks in a year. Quick maths. I actually suck at math, but that’s besides the point. I should go now. Goodbye! Hello, I’m back again. I really need to come up with different hello and goodbye messages, because I’ve already said “Hello, I’m back again” once before. Same with the “I should go now. Goodbye!” I said at the end of the previous section. I was going to explain what a “section” is, but I’m terrible at explaining things, so I’m not going to anymore. I guess you’ll just have to figure it out yourself. It’s probably not very hard to figure out, anyways. I guess I can just say that a section starts with me saying hello, and ends with me saying goodbye. That should be enough explaination, now that I think about it. Hey, do you ever feel like you never have any idea what you’re talking about? That’s my entire life. I just summarized it all in one sentence. On an unrelated note, I feel like half this LTE is just me talking about the LTE itself. I mean, press CTRL+F on this webpage, then type “LTE”. Look at all the times I use it in this text! Not counting the ‘lte’ in the word ‘multe’, of course. Dang, now the search results will include that, too. Anyways, half of this text is just me talking about how I’m trying to get this text to be the longest. Well, the longest LTE, anyways. I still have a long way to go. I’m only 12.7% of the way there. I mean, minus the four month gap, my estimation is that I’ve only been writing this for not even two weeks. So it makes sense that this LTE isn’t very long yet. Whenever I look at this webpage, it looks long at first glance, but the longer I look at it, the more I realize how short it actually is. It’s something that I can’t explain. For real this time. I just realized that none of this is helping the fact that half this LTE is about the LTE itself. I should bring up a new topic, but I don’t feel comfortable talking about much else. Why? Because, like I said, I never have any idea what I’m talking about. Most of this LTE is just me talking about LTEs or languages. Sometimes furries, but I don’t wanna go back into that territory at this point. But it doesn’t matter, because I’m still gonna write this LTE for as long as possible, even if it means talking about the same things half the time. Also, LEARN VIESA! Haven’t said that in a while, so I might as well bring it back. The documentation for Viesa is on this very website, so go ahead and read it! You might need to know some linguistic knowledge to understand it, though. In fact, you probably won’t understand most of it unless you know some amount about lingusitics, so you have been warned. If Viesa is too much for you, Pig Latin will probably be better for you. If it's so easy that kids can learn it, you can too! It's a language you can learn in probably five minutes, so why not give it a try? You may also enjoy Ubbi Dubbi, where you place 'ub' before every vowel sound. It's also a very easy language to learn, although not quite as popular. The thing is, none of these are even real languages. They're just codes, and very simple codes at that. You could probably crask Pig Latin or Ubbi Dubbi rather easily. Viesa too, actually. But I still enjoy them occasionally, even if Pig Latin and Ubbi Dubbi are inefficient and easy to crack, and Viesa is easy to crack yet unneccesarily difficult. I do make real languages, but I never put in the effort to learn them to fluency. At least I make them at all. Here’s a fun game: I will open up a random page from a book, and tell you the first word I see. English. That’s the word. Stay tuned for more fun games as you read through this LTE. We’re back, and we’re gonna play the same game as before. Ready? Subject. Now we’re gonna do it again. Reading. And again. Itself. Constituent. Grammar. Colloquial. Black. Outline. Add. About four of those words were language related. You’ll never guess why! (Spoiler alert: it’s a conlanging book). I’m running out of ideas now. I’m just gonna generate a random word and try to talk about it. Forbid. That’s the opposite of “allow”, I’m pretty sure. I don’t really know what else to say. Well, I guess I failed at generating a topic I could talk about. You know what's weird? My favorite word hasn't been used once in this entire text. I'm about to change that forever. Epic. Yup, my favorite word is "epic". I use it on a regular basis. I say "That's epic" all the time. It's a word I can't live without. Hey, I've now written more of this text after the 4 month gap than before it! Just thought I'd share that fact. Also, I'm gonna try and write as much as possible in this LTE today. I've already written more today than the day I first said I was gonna write as much as possible, so that's a good sign. The thing is, I don't know what to write about. I need to write about something, otherwise I won't write at all and I won't accomplish my goal. Wait, what goal should I set? How many characters should I write today? I'm gonna try and get 10,000 characters. I've already written almost 5,000 today, so from here I just have to write the equivellant of everything I've already written today. I'm just gonna try it and see if I make it. Maybe sometime in the future I'll do a bigger goal, like 15,000 or even 20,000 in one day. Actually, I don't know if 20,000 would even be possible for me. It might be, but it sounds like somewhat of a stretch for me to write that much in a single day. We'll see how long 10,000 takes, though. I'm already doing a bad job at this. I haven't typed anything here in several minutes. I need a topic. Um, Vabungula, I guess? Basically, it's a conlang created by Bill Price in 1965. It amazes me how one can work on a single conlang for that long. Most of the conlangs I start making die after 15 minutes. Anyways, I really like it because... um, I don't know, actually. There's not really anything about it that's super interesting (other than how long it's existed), it's just his personal conlang. Maybe it's the amount of development that went into it. It has over 5,000 dictionary entries and several texts written in the language. I'm sure most people reading this don't care about my language related talk, but I gotta make this long. I'm desperate to reach my 10,000 character goal. I've got 4,000 to go. I just found a website that generates random art from a seed. I just put this entire text as the seed, and it generated something quite nice. I would put the picture here, but I want this LTE to be nothing but text, so I won't do that. I've been playing with this for a while now. Many of the seeds produce boring pictures, but some of them are nice. For example, I just used "e" as the seed and it produced a nice looking picture. "a" looks nice too, arguably nicer. I've been using nothing but the word "nice" to describe these pictures. Maybe it's time to get a bigger vocabulary? "b" looks, um, good? I don't have the right vocabulary for this. I also don't feel like doing every single letter, because the pictures take some time to generate. But if you want to do it for yourself, just go to random-art.org and try it out! By the way, this is another website I found through pointlesssites.com. You know, the same website that lead me to the FlamingChicken LTE, which lead me to begin writing this whole thing. But what made me discover pointlesssites.com? Vsauce mentioned it. But what made me discover Vsauce? YouTube Reccomendations, probably. But what made me discover YouTube? As far as I remember, my dad showed it to me when I was 6. So I would like to thank my dad for being the reason I started writing this. He's the one who showed me YouTube, which reccomended me Vsauce, which mentioned pointlesssites.com, which brought me to the FlamingChicken LTE, which inspired me to start my own LTE. If he had never shown me YouTube, I wouldn't be here writing this text, and you wouldn't be reading it. Well, that's probably not true, because I probably would have discovered YouTube by other means, thus leading me to Vsauce, leading me to Vsauce, leading me to pointlesssites.com, leading me to the FlamingChicken LTE, leading me to... okay, I really need to stop now. I've gone too far. But you know what I haven't gone too far with? This LTE. I don't think I even can go too far with writing this text. Unless this text gets so long that it surpasses the 1GB storage limit of Neocities. In which case, I'll need to upgrade to Supporter in order to get a 50GB storage limit. But what if the text gets so long that is surpasses that? I don't think I'll ever make it there. I mean, 50GB is about 50 trillion characters. So I think we're good. I still need to get to 10,000 by the end of today. I've got 1,500 to go. Currently watching a livestream. It's reminding me of when I used to livestream back in 2016. I still kinda miss those days. But at the same time, I was quite awkward and had zero social skills, so I'm not sure if I'd want to go back. At this point, everything I've written today is longer than what can fit on the screen at once. At least on my computer screen. It probably changes with different screen resolutions and devices. But anyways, it's pretty unusual for that much of the LTE to be written in a single day. I don't want to pressure myself into writing this much every day, though. Last time I forced myself to complete a certain amount of something every day, it was overwhelming and I ended up losing motivation, thus letting down all my fans who were anticipating the August 30th, 2016 release date. Okay, the amount of eager fans was probably a number you could count on one hand, but still. By the way, if you're wondering what this "something" was, it was GoAnimated Garbage: The Movie, which was supposed to be an hour long episode of a series I made to make fun of random GoAnimate videos. In case you're not the type of person who knows what GoAnimate is... hoo boy. Basically, it's a drag-and-drop animation website infamous for the "grounded videos" that people made with it, among other types of videos. It's this whole community that I neither can explain nor want to explain. But I had somewhat of an association with that community back in the day. On my YouTube channel, I used to make a genre of GoAnimate video known as the "OS video". Typically an OS video is where some sort of hated character within the GoAnimate community forcefully installs their operating system onto a user's computer, and the user has to deal with this OS until they eventually find a way to "destroy" it. I made five of these videos. In chronological order: Caillou OS, Boots OS, Franklin OS, Little Bill OS, and Crap OS X. Caillou OS is the most viewed video on my main channel, which is unsurprising since Caillou is pretty much THE character associated with the GoAnimate community. When I made that video, it was a big transition for my channel. The channel's name was changed from Infinite Budgets, which had been my name since 2013 when I made crappy Roblox videos, to Allisima. All of my old videos were deleted, with the exception of my "Barney Errors", which was yet another genre of GoAnimate video. Basically, a Barney error is when a user's computer/console/whatever session is interrupted by a "Barney Error", a message informing the user that Barney has been killed, and the device must not be turned off because it's an "important message". There's also a bomb that's placed in Barney's "lair", the timer for which is displayed in the error. The user gets some amount of "chances", and every time the device is turned off, the user looses a chance and the time until the bomb explodes decreases. Eventually, the user turns off the computer enough times that there are no more chances left, the bomb explodes, and some sort of punishment happens. These punishments can range from having to downgrade your operating system, to having your computer destroyed, and in extreme cases, even to death. I once made a whole channel for Barney Errors, where I made about twenty of them before quitting. After that, I eventually quit GoAnimate all together, but I still made Crap OS X, an OS video made with Powerpoint. I also made an interactive OS parody called Windows Poop Editon, again with Powerpoint. Before that, I also made one called "Atch OS" using my old Windows XP netbook. I just checked to see if my old Weebly website still exists, since there's an Atch OS download on there and I wanted to see if it dissapeared from existence or not. Appearantly it does! I'm getting so much nostalgia from this website. It's like a window into 2016, when I had fun making these videos on a regular basis. I'm way past my 10,000 character goal now. I'm kinda glad I set this goal, but again, I'm not gonna force myself to do it everyday. I think I'm gonna stop writing for today. Bye! Hey, I'm back. Yes, that hello wasn't original either, since I already said it once. Specifically, after my sister seized the LTE and started spamming. You remember that, right? I hope you read through this whole thing instead of just picking a random part (which just happened to be this part) and reading only a tiny bit. Nah, I'm just kidding. Read this text however you want to, it doesn't matter if you read this entire text from start to finish or not. I mean, I did put some cringy stuff in here, as I keep mentioning. But it's on the Internet, and since recently, on my homepage, so I know people are gonna read it. Really the only reason I'm making this is because I have a weird obsession for writing giant walls of text. Guess what? I just added translations of this LTE into various conlangs on my website! But they're all very incomplete, and I probably won't finish them ever... I mean, if I'm gonna finish any of them, 'twill probably be the Viesa translation since it's the easiest to do.

anyway :D
here is a bit more random text:

This website will attempt to make the longest text ever, or as the pros call it, a 'LTE'. Basically just a blog of my life and random things I think about. I usually update per week (summer is an exception), but don't count on it.

Alright, so I guess this is a LTE now. Awesome. Anyways, welcome! I will try to make one of the longest texts ever on this very website WITHOUT copy and pasting! YAAAAY! okay. Well, I guess you should know a little bit about me. I am currently in science class. Yeah, that's it. okay, so MAAAAAAAAYBE I don't really know what to talk about. OH, I KNOW!!! I guess I'll talk about why I decided to make a LTE. So, the reason is that my friend is currently making one right now and I got inspired to do one of my own! Actually, you can find his website right here! Well, I should really get to working on my school work now. See you in next times!

Well, I'm back. I was in my language arts class but now I'm somewhere! i dont know where i am ples help. Okay, nevermind. SO, it seems that I really have no idea how to make a website using HTML. Honestly, I just used the tutorial to get a main idea on how to do this. So, uh yeah. Also, i'm going to explain the difference between JavaScript and HTML because I have nothing else to do so here WE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. So, basically HTML is just code that provides the primary structure of a website while JavaScript is what makes websites more interactive and dynamic. Credits to this website for giving me information. Also, just a random fact about me, I live in a shed! Awesome, right? Yeah, I can basically put anything really valuable in my shed because why would someone break into a shed? The reason is nothing, because nobody would break into a shed. Or maybe that person has a shed addiction and really likes breaking into sheds, I don't know. Also, there is a disease going around called the "Coronavirus." Yeah, it's not good. 10 people have already died in my state! So, that isn't good at all. I'm making sure that I wash my hands alot so that I don't get the virus. Uh, I don't really know what to talk about so, I'm going to search up important topics to talk about. Okay, so one of them was coffee, for some reason. So, I guess I'm going to talk about coffee. I personally don't like coffee myself but that is my opinion, you can like coffee if you want to! OH! I just thought about something to talk about. Opinions. Alot of people on the internet don't really care about opinions, but if you do care about opinions, then I respect you! Sometimes, people don't even care about opinions in the REAL world. Yeah, that's right, the REAL world. I don't understand those people. It is really disrespectful to not care about opinions because, well, they're important to people's lives! Okay, I'm gonna stop talking about opinions. Now, back to the "important topics to talk about" board. Okay, another one is change. Now, they didn't really give much information on what kind of "change" they ment. Did they mean change as in money or change as in changing appearance or personality? I have no idea. So, I will not talk about "change" but instead I will talk about something I'm going to add to my website soon! It's gonna be a counter, I'm not going to tell what it will count but it will be a counter. I will just need to test it on a different webpage! Okay, I will update this when I'm done adding it, bye bye now!

Okay, I'm back! I added the counter! As you can see, it's an end of the world counter! I got the counter from this website, but I don't know how trustworthy it is. But I'm gonna use it anyways hehehehehehehehheheheheh. Okay, so, what now? I think I might add a characters counter. If you do not know what that is, I will tell you. It basically tells how many characters are in a text. But I don't know HTML THAT well, so I will probably try to look one up. Uhh, I honestly don't have anything else to say. Y'know, making LTEs are hard work. First, you gotta figure out what you want to talk about and then you have to TYPE it. Also, if you use copy and paste while making an LTE, then you will be SHAMEDDDDDDDDDDD amongst the LTE community. So, here are the rules to making an LTE. First, do NOT copy and paste. If you do, then it is not an actual LTE. Second, don't just spam characters. This isn't really a rule, but I honestly think it's not a good LTE if you just spam characters, but go ahead if you truly wish to. Third, don't copy other LTEs. Just, don't. That's pretty much it for the rules. I hope you all learned something about LTEs today, and make sure you do your LTE homework!!! I'm just kidding, there is no homework, because this isn't a school, it's a website. Alright, I think I'm done here. See you laters!

Ay bois, I'm back now! Right now I'm currently in my school's gallery, which you can look at other student's artwork. It's very cool! I wish my artwork was there though, maybe one day... ANYWAYS, I guess I should talk about what is happening currently in my life. So, I'm getting a new dog! YAY!! Yeah, I have had 3 dogs in the past, but I still have one of those dogs. The other two died so R.I.P. But yeah, a new dog! It's a boy and its breed is a Pitbull! no, not the singer, the DOG. Just had to make that clear. Uh, I do not know what to talk about. UHHH. I'm going back to the "important things to talk about" board again. Alright, one of them was about free time, so I will talk about my free time! Well, right now I only work on this website for my free time, at least at school anyways. But at home I usually watch YouTube videos cause I have nothing else to do! Okay, what else.... uhhhhhhh. OH!!!!! I will talk about my classes for next year! So, this year I took a theater class, an animation class, and a pottery class which I didn't like very much. Not because of the teacher, but because the class didn't really interest me. You may be asking, "THEN WHY DID U cHOOSE IT DUMBO!!?!?!??!?!?!?" That is because I just wanted to try it out, please don't yell at me. :( Okay, so my classes for next year will be theater class again, (cause i need to take it for two years to progress to the next level) a graphic design class, and a music class. I hope I will like these classes a lot!! Uh, great, now I don't know what to talk about again. I was thinking about adding that character counter, but I haven't searched it up yet. So, that's what I will do now! Okay, sadly I didn't find a character counter for my website so, unless I somehow get really good at HTML, it's not happening. Sorry. :/ Also, my friend has made his LTE using the Neocities website editor! Here it is! I hope you guys go see it as he actually inspired me to do this LTE, as I said earlier.

Wow, it sure has been a while since I've updated this. Hello! I am from the future... actually, not really. It's currently September 18, 2020 as of me writing this. Yeah, quite a long time since I last updated my LTE... Anyways, my school has switched to remote learning so I'm writing this from home! Yeah, awesome, I know. I honestly prefer being in school rather than being at home since my internet connection isn't very stable... Oh! Also, my state is completely covered in smoke!! So, I have to keep the doors closed. It's not like I went outside a lot anyways, haha. So, other than that, things have been going pretty goodz! Also, you remember when I talked about my new dog a few months ago? Yeah, he's REALLY BIG now. Even bigger than my older dog, and she's 5 years old! Uh,.. yeah i don't know what to talk about. From 6 months ago to now, not much has happened, at least in my life. I guess I could talk about that character counter I WAS going to add. So, I looked on the internet (keep in mind that this was 6 months ago) and I didn't find anything. So, I'm guessing I'll need to make it myself. But, there is one problem. I literally do not know how to do something like that. Yeah, so maybe I can look up some tutorials or something but it probably won't be added, so uh, sorry. Welp, I think this is it for this entry. Maybe I'll return to doing this on a daily basis, but don't count on it. See you laters!

Hey hey!! Yeah, it's me again. That's right, ME! It is now officially 2021! Well, it was about 5 days ago... yeah i'm a little late. BUUUUT, that's not why I'm updating this again. The S O L E REASON I'm updating my LTE is because my friend updated his! Yeah, that's pretty much it. AAAAAAAnyway, I'm thinking of making a game... Yeah, that's right!!!! The engine I'm thinking of using is GameMaker Studio 2, but it cost money so uhhhhhhhhhh maybe that won't happen. But, I can't give up hope! Also, I am very hungry right now so I need some food... NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, not RIGHT now, but soon cause if I don't eat then I will Die. Yeah, no good. Also, I usually update this website on my Chromebook from my school but this time I decided to update it on my computer. Let me tell you, it's WAAAY better. "Why?", you may ask. Well, two reasons. First, for some reason, editing text on the Chromebook is really glitched. Basically, when you click on text and either put a character or remove one, it edits the text a couple characters back instead. Very annoying... The other reason is because my computer is just better than the Chromebook in any way. It's faster, better, and a lot of other things I guess. Anyway, I heard of this thing called a "favicon". Basically, you can put a favicon on your website and a little icon shows up on the tab thing in pretty much every browser. This icon also shows up in bookmarks as well!! So, I'm going to try to add that and I'll get back to you, viewer, if it works. Hey, I'm back nowes! I have successfully added the favicon to the website!!! YEAAAA!!!!!!!!! The icon is actually a picture of my profile picture, well, my school account picture. Anyways, I guess this will be all for now. Good in byes!

Hello again! I'm back with a few new things to add. But first, I must state the date this is being written on! January 11th, 2021 is that date! Yeah, not a very special date, or at least I don't think it is... Anyway, I guess I should get in to what I'm adding before I talk about anything else. Okay, first off, my friends friend is now making a LTE! Yeah, awesome, I know. You can check that out right here. Alright, the other thing I'm adding. I'm attempting to add a sorta music player thing at the bottom of the screen. Currently, it is inplemented but I'm having trouble properly centering it. Yeah, I'm gonna have to do some more research with centering elements in HTML... Also, the recording set on there is of me saying some random thing I thought of in 2 seconds. Wow, I'm so proud of myself!!!!! I was originally planning to just put the MP3 file into the site directory, but that needed a Supporter membership. So, I exploited a loophole through Google Drive instead! Yeah, I'm a professional hakrman... Okay, not really, I literally know nothing about hacking. But, I bypassed the Supporter requirement so I think I'm pretty cool. As of right now, I'm in my language arts class. Honestly, it just seems more enjoyable than some of my other classes. I have no idea why, but that was just something I noticed. Also, here's a random fact, I'm hungry. Very hungry. We also have no food. I think I'm going to starve!!!! Good thing I have these crumbs I keep in my closet... Oh! My friend also updated his LTE! Yeah, go check both of those LTEs out. Go do it, go check them out. I SAID GO CHECK THEM OUT!!!!!! Sorry, I was getting a little mad... Anyway, lets talk about my grades! They're, uh, not good. Quite bad, actually. Yeah, lets talk about something else... Oh, I was also thinking of adding some background music to my website to add more atmosphere y'know? But, I realized that a lot of people don't like music that automatically plays on websites, so maybe I'll scrap that idea. Maybe. ;) Welp, I'm going to get some food, try to properly center the audio player and maybe update this more.

Hey, just wanted to give a quick update. I managed to center the audio player so that it looks centered enough. I have no idea if it is truly centered but it looks like it is so I'm keeping it as it is. Also, I made an "untrue" LTE! An "untrue" LTE is an LTE that doesn't obey the rules "true" LTEs have to follow. Basically, you can copy and paste as much as you want and you can copy from other LTEs if you truly wish to. I personally won't be copying from any LTEs but if you want to make an "untrue" LTE then you can do whatever with it. Anyway, that's pretty much it for this entry. Good night or day or morning or afternoon!

Wow, it sure has been a while. Well, not as long as my last break, which ended in September of 2020, but still quite long. Anyway, HI!!!!!1 It is currently March 11th, 2021 as of me writing this. Yeah, like I said, a while since I updated this. I'll probably update my "untrue" LTE today too, since I want to continue more on that. Now, lets get to business. You may be wondering, "Hey, what happened?!?!?! Why did you take a break?!?!?!" Well, since I am an actual human (surprising I know), I needed to actually work on my life so that I don't fail to live!!!! So, I took a break from updating my LTEs to work on getting my life together so I have time to do things such as updating this! I may take some more breaks in the future, but hopefully they won't be very long, unlike the break I took until September. Anyway, what else has happened? Well, not much really. I've just been mostly sleeping. That's it. Also, unfortunately, I missed the first year birthday of the creation of my LTE. DARN!!!!!!! Maybe next year... Actually, you know what I just realized? It has been exactly two months since I last updated this. Awesome!!!!!! I'm currently in my science class right now and we're doing some sort of project where we have to make an instrument ourselves using materials we have. We just got assigned codenames for this project and the topic for those codenames were about plants. So, I searched up some plants and named myself "Carpet weed". Yes, that's right, carpet weed. Why? Because I can!! Now, like many other LTE makers do in their LTEs, I'm going to have something that will be a signature icon of a LTE... When I get home. Sorry for the cliffhanger but I'm running out of time before I have to go home, so see you laters!!!!!1 Well, for now. :D

Hey, remember when I said I would update my LTE as soon as I got home? Yeah, I totally forgot about that. So, uh, sorry about that. Anyway, hi and welcome back to my cooking show! Wait, wrong LTE... Yeah, I'll be updating my other LTE today too (if I remember to of course). It won't be as soon as I update this LTE because I only have my chromebook with me right now since I'm in school as of writing this. If you didn't know, chromebooks are terrible when viewing/editing large pages of text due to their limited hardware. Plus, with the little RAM chromebooks have, Google Chrome also takes a lot of that RAM so that the chromebook barely has anything to work with. So, I'll have to only edit my other LTE on my computer as it has a lot more powerful hardware than my chromebook. Anyway, enough of that. Now, I was talking about something that will be a signature icon of not just any LTE, but mine. You may be wondering, "What's this icon?!?!??!" Well, this icon is not just any regular icon. It's a very powerful icon called "The Pie God". Yeah, thats right. The holy Pie God! This icon is a very power being who can destroy millions of people within a second. Now, I'm not really allowed to share this, but I'll make an exception this time. This is the first real photograph of the Pie God. Yes, very dangerous. Unfortunately, I do not know his current whereabouts, which means he's still out there, possibly committing several federal crimes. Here's a tip to defending yourself from the Pie God. If he approaches, you have to praise the Pie God and bow down saying, "All hail the holy Pie God! The being of three identities, please spare me from your holy punishment!" Yeah, he really likes being praised. If you do this, there's a 99% chance he'll spare you. However, the 1% of people who are not so lucky get turned into a freshly home-baked cherry pie. Like I said earlier, he likes to commit federal crimes. The crime he mostly likes to commit is, of course, tax fraud. Why? He hates doing his taxes. Anyway, that's pretty much it for this entry. I may update this more today but don't count on it. Good day bye now!!

Hi hey, just updating this cause I'm bored. Why am I bored? Homework! I don't like homework at all!!! I am currently attempting to finish my homework but I just can't. Not that it's really hard or anything, but I just can't focus. For some reason, whenever I try to do homework, I'm immediately unmotivated and I just don't do it. Of course, my grades have been severely affected from this and that's the reason why I'm doing homework in the first place. It's all just one big loop! First, start homework. Second, become unmotivated and lose focus. Third, look at grades and try to improve them. Those three things have been the things I've been doing for a few weeks now. It's very annoying... Maybe I should go see a tutor or something, but I have a feeling that won't help very much. Anyway, enough about all of that. Let's talk about my other LTE. Yeah, I still haven't updated it. I know I said I would be updating it on my previous entry but I still haven't. Yeah, you can blame my homework for that!! ...Which is my fault. Alright fine, blame me!!! I can't really go onto my computer right now, since I'm supposed to be doing homework right now and if I went on my computer my parents would probably yell at me. I could try to update it on my chromebook but, like I said in my previous entry, the amount of RAM a chromebook has is very small so it might not even load. But, you know what? I'm going to do it anyways! Well, I'll try. I think that's it for today. Well, have day good now!!

Hey hi, it's me from the future! Well, not really. I'm writing this on March 19th, 2021. But, to be honest, you probably knew that since it says this website was last updated on March 19th, 2021. Anyway, I'm currently in my last class for the day, then I'll be free from school for the next few days!! Just kidding. If you read my last entry, then you probably know that I have a lot of homework that I need to catch up on, since my grades are not very good. Actually, I don't think I ever said that in my last entry... Well, you know now that I'm doing pretty terrible in school! What I'm currently doing right now is updating this website, of course. In my last class for Friday, we have some extra time to do whatever until the class ends. So, instead of being productive, I'm updating this! Also, about my other LTE. I probably won't be updating it for a few weeks or maybe even months. Turns out that my theory about editing my other LTE on a chromebook was correct. It's horrible! So yeah, I'm basically grounded from my computer until I finish all my homework. Just great!!!!1!!!1 Eh, oh well. At least I can still update this site without any major problems. Yeah, the text glitch thing is still pretty annoying, but I've gotten used to it. Anyway, my class is about to end so cya for now!

Almost 3 months have passed since I've last updated this... Yeah, hello! I'm back after nearly 3 months of inactivity. I should probably say the current date first... Today is September 1st, 2021 and school has started back again! Yay! Well, maybe I'm not THAT happy about it since summer is over... BUT! I'm finally doing in-person school FULL TIME! Yeah! No more half-weeks of staying at home and going in-person! Although I am kind of sad that summer is over, at least I get to go to school like I used to. Anyway, you're probably wondering why I didn't update this over the summer. Reason: Didn't want to. Yeah, that's pretty much it. I was going to update it before summer started but I was too late and just decided that I would leave it as it is. So, the question now is... Will I keep updating this or just abandon it again? I'll probably keep updating it until summer arrives but nothing is set in stone for now. I may just stop updating this one day during the school year to focus on grades or something like that. But, I'll try to keep updating this for as long as I can. Anyway, what to talk about now? Actually, I should probably talk about something I've been adding to the website for a while. It's this little thing called "Archives"! Basically, the Archives are individual entries sorted and dated in a more fancy way instead of just being on one page like all the entries are right now. Of course, it's not finished yet and there are some dates missing but it's still a work in progress, so yeah. Anyway, that's it for this entry. Hopefully I'll work on this tomorrow or some other day but, it's not guarenteed. Okay, g'bye!

Hey, whaddup! I'm back and guess what?!?! The Archives are finally finished!! It took me way less time than I thought it would but, to be honest, it has a really simple look so it would've took only a short amount of time. Anyway, you can check out the archives through this link or on the top of this page. I'm going to make this very short because my class ends in 5 minutes so yeah! Anyway, goodbye and farewell!

Hi. Welcome Back To Another Entry In My Longest Text Ever (Lte). I Am Going To Talk Like This Because I Have No Reason Why But Seriously, Why Do People Do This. They Always Say "Because I Can" Or Some Nonsensical Reason. Okay, I'm going to stop that now. I always wonder why people do that. I get that it's harmless and something to not get mad about, but still. It's just annoying. Do other people get annoyed by that as well or is it just me? I have no idea... Actually, I might make a Google Forms later about that. Anyway, just wanted to talk about some things I'm going to be removing. First, the Experimental Music Player Thing That I Haven't Fully Worked Out Yet But Maybe I Will Sometime In The Future, I Don't Know™. Yes, I know you all loved the Experimental Music Player Thing That I Haven't Fully Worked Out Yet But Maybe I Will Sometime In The Future, I Don't Know™, but it's essentually useless and I can't figure out how to center it properly. There probably is a way to center it, but I'm too lazy to look up any more websites. Plus, it's just talking up a lot of space. So, might as well remove it to give the website a better look. Now, the second thing. I'm TEMPORARILY removing the LTE Hub. Why? The URL was exposing the school district I'm currently in. But, don't worry! The LTE Hub isn't gone for good! I'm remaking it as a page for this website! It keeps consistency and it won't expose my location! It's a win-win situation! That's all I wanted to talk about for right now. I'll probably update this when I've remade the LTE Hub, but for now, goodbye!

Hey, I'm going to make this short, but I've finished the new LTE Hub! You can find it at the top of the page. Also, I want to apologize for the lack of entries for the past few days, a lot of stuff has been happening these past few days. This pace may continue, but I'll try to update this as often as I can. Anyway, good Bye .

Hello, it's that time again! What do I mean? Y'know, THAT time. You still don't know? I mean it's time to update this again! Yeah, I'll try to make this a longer entry, but things may happen. By things, I mean that my current period might end and I might not even be able to update this at all! But, I'll try to. Anyway, I guess I'll just talk about what comes on my mind while I'm writing this. So, about the form for the LTE Hub. I'm going to make a new email dedicated for that form and that form only. Okay, maybe not JUST the form, maybe something else, I don't really know yet. But, I will be making a new email to put the form on. Why? I don't want to take any chances to give out any information that shouldn't be put on the internet. So, I'll just make a new email that doesn't show anything that doesn't need to be shown. You may be thinking I'm probably taking really extreme measures for something so minimal, and you may be right. But, the Internet can be a harsh place. If people don't like you. they may try everything in your power to bring you down. Whether it's by ruining a person's reputation, or revealing personal information about them. I really don't want to take that chance. Anyway, enough about that. Here's another thing that just appeared in my head. Will I be adding anything new to the website. Of course I will! I don't really know what I'll add yet, but I have so many concepts to what to add to this website to make it even cooler! Of course, some things are easier said than done. Let's talk about something else. So, how long will I keep updating this website? I want to update this website for as long as possible. One of the things that I've thought of doing for a while is making a website. Whether it be something like a blog, a game, or something totally different. Still, the thought of maintaining a website just sounded really awesome to me and it still does. If you couldn't tell, this is something that I really like doing. Of course, things may happen. I might grow out of "updating a website nobody looks at" once I get older. Actually, I'm not sure if I'm the only one that looks at this website. From my site traffic stats, it seems like I'm getting a lot of unique visits. So, if anyone is reading this and regularly looks at my website when it gets updated, then thanks! It's nice to know that some people appreciate my work, even if I'm just writing words. Okay, I'm gonna have to cut this short for now, g'bye!

Hey, what's Up. Sorry that I haven't updated this in a Week. I actually went on vacation last Wednesday, so I wasn't able to update this. But anyway, this entry is going to be more short. Why? Well, I've decided to take a break from updating this for a little bit. Yes, I know on my last entry that I said that "I want to update this website for as long as possible", but I've been kinda getting burnt out from updating this site, even if it's just small things I've been adding. But, that's not the only reason why I'm going to be taking a break. The second reason is because I have a lot of homework I need to catch up on since I went on vacation. So, yeah. I need to finish that. I'm not very good at multitasking, so I won't be able to finish my homework efficiently while still updating this website daily. So yeah, sorry about that, but I have a life that I need to work on!! (and homework too I guess). Also, my friend updated his LTE!! Make sure to check that out, because if you don't... nothing will happen. BUT! I will not like you, if you don't. So, better go check it out!!!! Okay, cya!

Man, it's been two weeks since I've last updated this... Which, in reality, isn't a very long time. BUT STILL!!! It's a long time to me... Anyway, Hi Hello Welcome Back To Another YouTube Video. So, you might be wondering to yourself "WOA!!!!!!!! Is your Break Completed!!!!???? More Updates?!??!?!??!?!?". Well, not exactly. I'm still on my break, as my grades are not very good right now. They're better than they were two weeks ago, but they still need to be improved, or else my parents will yell at me :(. So, if I'm still on my break, why am I updating this? Well, to simply put it, I was just bored. That's all... Yeah, I'm in study hall right now, but since I don't really have anything to do, I might as well update this to prevent my website from DYING!!!!!!!! Yeah, death, not good. Also, my friend updated his LTE! ...five days ago. Yeah, so I'm a bit late. But, y'know what? I DO NOT CARE AT ALL!!! BECAUSE I WAS ON BREAK!!! Okay, yeah. I might as well talk about the Archives for a second as well. So, y'know that thing I spent nearly a week on to make my entries into a more readable format? Yeah, I'm probably not going to be continuing it. Or, at least, I won't be updating it for each individual entry I add onto here. Which means, I'll probably add the entries to the Archive when I feel like it. But, it's a pain to update though, so I decided I'll just update it every few entries. Anyway, that's all I have to say for now. See you in like, what, 4 years? Okay, probably not THAT long, but somewhere around 1-2 weeks. Back to the grind of education...

Hey, what's up?????? The sky, obviously, I think, I'm not sure, okay I'll stop this now. Anyway, I'm back, I think... Okay, I'm probably not back from my "break". Yeah, y'know, my "break". What, you don't know about my "break"? Man... how could you NOT know about my "break"?! Okay, so basically, I took a "break" from updating the website because I needed to get better grades. Yeah, about that... I recently got a report on my grades and they're better than I thought. However, my math grade isn't very good right now. Everything else is either an A or a B! Yeah, very good, I think. Anyway, about my "break". So, being totally honest here, being on my "break" has given me time to think about a lot of things. More importantly, how I'm going to continue updating this website. So, I've decided something that may or may not affect the future of this website. There's good news and bad news to this decision... I'll start with the bad news first. So, I've decided instead of updating this website every weekday, I'll just be updating it once every week. So, updates to the website will take more time. BUT! BUT!! BUT!!! With me taking more time to update the website, it'll give me more time to add more content than I could add within a day. What this "more content" is, however, is mostly undetermined, as I don't really have anything else to work on the website besides the Archives (which i still haven't updated yes im lazy). The only thing I know that will be apart of the "more content" is longer entries. Possibly, entries even longer than any on this website so far! Which, isn't really a lot, but it's a lot to me okay!?!?!?!? In fact, I already have an idea that I can add!! So, basically, I'll make a Google Document (or use something similar) to be used as a "beta view" of upcoming content. Actually, wait, I've thought of something else... Basically, beta entries will be on the Google Doc and other content will be on either a new website (with a new url) or a new webpage (using this url). I already have a similar webpage on this website, but it's private and I haven't used it in a long time. But, hey, maybe I will use that webpage sometime soon, I have no idea... Anyway, it seems that my weekly quota is up for now, so cya!!!

Hey guys, just wanted to update this cause I'm bored. Also, just to note, this will not be the update of the week, that'll probably come out tomorrow. Anyway, I don't really have a lot of time before my next class so I'll make this short. Anyway, since I was just, y'know, being bored n' all... I decided to go look through some of the LTEs in the LTE Hub (which you should go check out by the way). So, I was reading Kenneth Iman's LTE and as I was reading through, I just got nostalgic for some reason. This didn't happen when I was reading the other LTE's, like Flaming Chicken's for example. The reason I think I was feeling nostalgic over this specific LTE was because the things that were written seems to be very similar to my experiences in elementary school. If I'm being completely honest, I really really miss elementary school. I had a lot of friends there that cared about me a lot. I cared about them a lot, too. I wanted to stay with them up until graduation, y'know, as childhood friends. 'Course, things didn't go as planned. What happened is that I went to a different middle school than they did. The reason this happened is that the middle school I was supposed to go to had a really bad rating, and my parents didn't want me to go there. Anyway, I wanted to stay in touch with them, but in the current situation I was at the time, I couldn't. Then... nothing. I had started a new social life, with little to no friends. Now, I'm not saying the school I go to now is bad, it's actually pretty fun. But, would I have preferred staying with my friends but going to a terrible school or leaving my friends to go to a better school. In my personal opinion, I would have stayed with my friends, and I would've if I could've. Unfortunately, even if I told my parents that I wanted to stay with my friends, they still would've made me go to a different school anyway. So, my choice wouldn't have mattered even if I chose otherwise. But, like I said before, the school I'm going to isn't bad. Well, it has a few flaws in my opinion. First, instead of having regular classes, we have "art" classes, because I'm currently going to a art school. Of course, we still do have basic things like math, science, english, but that's pretty much it. So, the majority of my classes on a regular school day usually have one academic class and around 3 art classes. Now, you may be wondering why this is a flaw in my opinion. Well, I guess I could've worded it better, but I've already written it so I DON'T CARE UHAHUAHUAHUHUAUHA!!! Anyway, why I don't like it very much is because it's just very confusing to me. The many classes that we have available, I mean, it's good to have a big selection of choices, but it's just kinda confusing rather than a normal high school, which only has the usual stuff like math, science, english, y'know. I do enjoy this school, but I would've had a better experience if I had my childhood friends with me. Alas, poor me... Okay, I'll stop talking about this now. Anyway, you remember at the start of this entry that this wouldn't be the update of the week? Well, it's actually Wednesday as of writing this. ...yeah I ran out of time yesterday. But, I guess this is the update of the week. Yeah, I expected this to be much shorter, but look what happened!! I got passionate about my writing and now this giant wall of text has appeared!!!! Wait, isn't that the whole point of this website...? Huh, y'know, for some time I completely forgot that I made this website to make the "Longest Text Ever"... But, looks like I forgot why I made this website and just started to make this into a blog kind of. Hey, isn't a LTE just a blog?!?!?!? Maybe, I don't know. But, if I'm being honest, I don't think I ever ment to take this website seriously, y'know, telling whoever that visits this website about me that isn't just made up. This whole website was just ment to be One Big Joke(trademark)!! But now, it's become into so much more... Okay, not really, I still don't take this website seriously. But STILL!!!!! Writing about things that happened in my life onto some website that ANYONE can visit really shows that I've grown to like this website. Y'know, maybe these inexperienced skills of HTML editing might get me somewhere in the future... Nah, I doubt it. After all, I AM just using the p tag and writing a bunch of text... But hey, you never know... Or, wait, it's probably "I never know...", I have no idea. Now, on another note, I'm pretty sure this is the longest entry on this website so far! Wow!! I'm actually doing what I made this website for!!! To make the Longest Text Ever!!!! Look mom, I'm winning!!!!! Okay, maybe not. It'll probably take a long time before this LTE reaches the character amount of a LTE like Flaming Chicken's. But still, I have a dream!! To, uh, surpass around 200,000 characters on a website... Maybe I should be doing something better with my time. But, hey, as long as I don't die, I'll probably still be updating this website. Key word: probably. Anyway, that's all I have to say for this entry. But, for some reason, I still have the urge to write more, but I don't know WHAT to write, so I'll probably be updating this later. Or not, that's up to me to decide. I'll also probably go and fix character counts for both Pink-ish Pickle's and my LTE. Anyway, bye and good!! Also, my G key is broken I think. It's hard to press down...

So, just wanted to update this to show you guys this email I got. It's a email with a promotion about Chipotle on... my school email. Just to let you guys know, I don't sign up my school email for any specific services or mailing lists, so this email came from my school administrators themselves... Also, for some reason, it seems like they didn't finish the last sentence, which is really funny to me for some reason. Take a look!! "THANK YOU AND"

What Sup, I'm bored so I'm updating this for the third time this week. Yeah, I'm not really following my plan of "only updating my LTE once per week" but y'know what? I DON'T CARE!!!!!!!!!! Okay, maybe I care a little bit, but, uhh... what was I talking about again? I dunno, something probably. AAAnnnyyywwwaaayyy, I've been thinking of adding something to the website. It's actually inspired by what the Pink-ish Pickle guy (my friend) tried to do a little while ago. Yeah, that's right, it's notifications!!! For when the website gets updated!!! Now, I have two ways of going about this. Way 1: Using some epic Javascript to send push notifications!! Way 2: Using a boring email address to send email notifications... I want to do Way 1, but I don't know if I'm skilled enough to add it!! I might even need a server of my own to even send those notifications!!! But, I could do Way 2 pretty easily, but I personally don't think it would be very intuitive... But hey, if I can't do Way 1, then I guess I'll have to do that. Or, I could just, not try to add notifications at all. BUT, that's BORING!!!!! Anyway, I'm going to research how to add push notifications now, so Bye, Maybe, I Don't Know...

Alright, so I've added push notifications!! But, it's through a third-party service called SendPulse and it's kind of buggy, but it still works nonetheless!!! I would try to use the way Google posted on their developer blog, but most of the links to add the relevent things are blocked on the Chromebook, so I'll need to wait until I get home, which is in about 35 minutes... Anyway, yeah, that's pretty much it. I might update this more for this to include the better Google notification API rather than this, so Yeah. Anyway, if you want to have push notifications, then press the link on the top that says about notifications. Anyway, Bye Bye .

Hey, so, what's up. Yeah, remember when I said I would update the notification API? Yeah, that's probably not happening anytime soon. Why, you may ask? Well, it's because I have about 17 projects due this week, and they're all heavily counted against my grade, so if I do badly or don't turn them in, everything, and I mean, everything will go wrong. So, uh, yeah, that'll probably have to wait until later. Anyway, why am I updating this? Just bored, is all. Yeah, I'm currently in study hall right now, but I don't really have anything to work on, or rather anything I CAN work on. All of my supplies are in their respective classes, so yeah, can't really do much about that. Anyway, I guess I'll write about random stuff that comes to my head until study hall is over. Anyway, uh, so, yeah, uh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah, yes, yup, mhm, yeah. Okay, nothing's coming to mind. So, I'll do the only thing I can do... Go to Google!!! And steal ideas!!!! From other people!!!!! Yeah, very fun. Alright, I found a website full of conversation starters, so yeah, I guess I'll just do that! Here's the website if you want to take a look. Anyway, first thing. "Usually the best way to start a conversation is to talk about your current situation." Alright, I guess I'll talk about my current situation. I'm currently in study hall, writing to my LTE, and uh, being bored? Okay, that isn't working. Next one!! "2. Job / Work. What do you do? How long have you worked there? Do you like it? How are your coworkers? What’s the best / worst thing about being a (their job)?" Uh, alright. So, first question, I don't do anything for work, I don't have a job, I'm not even old enough... Second question, uh, like I said before, I don't have a job, so there's no timeframe that I've been "working". Third question, uh, maybe? I don't have a job still, but I guess I like not having a job... Fourth question, I don't have any coworkers... Because I don't have a job... Finally, fifth question, I guess the best thing about not having a job is that I don't have to do any extra work, but the worst thing is that I don't get any extra money, well, not like I was getting money in the first place... Hey, that gives me an idea, maybe I should put ads on this website... So, that way I can get some extra money!! If I were to put ads, then it wouldn't be those annoying pop-up ads, it'll be like a banner ad stuck at either the top or bottom of the website, and it wouldn't move with the screen either. Also, I wouldn't add one of those annoying anti-adblocker things. I always hated those things... I know people want money, but people can have a choice to not allow annoying ads on their visit to a website. And plus, even if you can't squeeze any money out of the computer users using adblocker, you can always get that money out of mobile users!! Oh, wait, adblock browsers exist on mobile too... At least, on the Google Play Store. I don't know if there are any on the App Store on Apple devices, because I know how protective Apple devices are about installing unknown apps... But, that's not a bad thing!! Sometimes, people just install everything they see, and then they get a virus!! So, to combat that, Apple doesn't allow you to install unknown apps unless you've jailbroken your device or you're an app developer. On Android, however, you can install any unknown app with ease. Yeah, it may be good, like installing an advanced version of YouTube for example (which actually exists and you should install it, it's called YouTube Vanced it's very good now go install it now). Wow, I've written a lot... That's pretty nice!!! And it's not even Wednesday, either... So, does that mean there's going to be an EXTRA long entry tomorrow? Probably not. But, y'know what?? Actually, I forgot what I was going to say. Anyway, study hall is going to end in 5 minutes, and then I'l go eat some food, because I'm very hungry, and lunch is next in the schedule. So, what else to talk about... I guess I should go to that website again. Here I go!!! Okay, turns out that the rest of the topics on the website aren't very good to write about... So, I guess I'll go do something else. I've just discovered something horrible... The snake game... it's been exterminated from the Chromebooks... May you rest in peace, Google snake game. Oh, wait. There's that other snake game by Google as well. Well, I might as well link it!! Here, take this website and protect it with your life. Anyway, it's time to go now, so cya!!

Alright, so turns out the real snake game by Google wasn't exterminated from the Chromebooks, it just wasn't loading for me. Phew, that would've been bad. Anyway, if you wanna play the real snake game, click here. Anyway, I'm gonna eat some food now, because I am very hungry, okay Bye Bye For Now But Not For Now Ha Ha Just Kidding Okay I Will Stop Now.

Hey Ther e You, I'm updating this Now!!! Yeah, I'm bored again, so I've decided to update this until my current class is over. Just so that you know, this class is very boring... I've even slept through the whole class one time!! Basically, all we do is just make projects and they get graded. Sounds awesome, right? Well, NOT FOR ME!!! You wanna know why I don't think it's awesome?? It's because... Actually, I don't know. I guess the only reason I can think of is that I'm just very lazy. Alright, I've thought of a reason why I don't like this class. Basically, we do make projects, but the entire class is about pretty much forcing people to work together, even if you don't want to. Well, at least it was like that a few years ago. Now, it's basically just one of those classes that forces you "get better" and "push your limits". Thing is, the artfom I chose was visual art, and you wanna know a little secret? I'M NOT GOOD AT VISUAL ART!! Now, you may be asking, "Then why did you choose it dumbo!??!?!?" ...Wait, hold on. I feel like I've said that before... Eh, nevermind. Anyway, I chose it because it's literally the only thing that I'm familiar with doing, even if I'm not good at it. Now, if there was an option to do anything you want for your project, I would choose, eh, I dunno... Maybe making a website? I think I'm good at that. Key words: I think. Of coruse, I would choose that if we had an option to do that, but alas, there isn't. They pretty much force you to do one of the various artforms we practice at our school (because I'm going to an art school). Which pretty much consist of everything that I'm not interested in. I knew I should've gone to the tech school instead... Ah, oh well, I've already been here for about 4 years now, so I might as well continue going here. Plus, I have friends here!! I can't just abandon them!!! Actually, to be honest, I don't think they would care very much... But still, for my mental health, I can't leave!! Or else, I'd just be doing what happened to me all those years ago... Anyway, uh, sorry, I kinda got sidetracked. All that I talked about in this entry so far isn't the true reason why I decided to make this. The actual reason is that we, at the LTE Science Institution, have made an amazing breakthrough!! Well, I didn't do anything, it was mostly my friend, the Pink-ish Pickle guy, that did all of the work. You may be wondering what I'm talking about, so I'll tell you. My friend translated the message on WhileTrue's LTE!! Yeah, awesome, I know. If you don't know what happened to the WhileTrue LTE, I'll tell you. Basically, the LTE was replaced with a message in a different langauge that I couldn't translate through Google Translate. Now, onto the good stuff. So, why couldn't I translate it through Google Translate? Well, it's because it wasn't a real langauge at all!! It's actually something called a conlang, which is basically a language someone made up. Now, which conlang was used for the crypted message? Well, my friend thinks it's Votgil. In fact, he actually translated the message to something moderately readable!!! It isn't fully understandable, as there are some random words in sentances that don't make sense at all, but at least it's translated. Anyway, if you wanna read the translated message, go to the Pink-ish Pickle LTE (link in the LTE Hub cause I'm too lazy to link it here), and scroll down until you see an entry mentioning the WhileTrue LTE (which as of writing this, is the most recent entry, so just scroll down all the way until you reach the end of the webpage). You may be wondering why I didn't just copy and paste the message into here. There's two reasons to that question. First, it's because I want YOU to go look at HIS website!! It's Very Cool And Awesome and if you do not Agree then you will Die in 47 Minutes and 23 Seconds. Second, haven't you read the rules to making an LTE in my third entry??!??!?!?! It says to not copy and paste, and to not copy other LTEs!! I must follow through with the rules, or I'll be shamed amongst the LTE community!!!!! Y'know, it kind of seems inconvienient to look at the rules to making an LTE on my third entry only,,, So, I'm going to make a new page with the rules to making an LTE!! Actually, I've thought of something else, too!!! I'll make a tutorial on how to make an LTE on Neocities!!!! Oh my god, I'm flowing with ideas!!!!!!!! Nobody can stop me now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, I'll stop with the exclamation mark spam... I just really like the exclamation mark... Don't judge me!!! Okay, uh, I'm going to make that webpage now, I'll probably update this again once I'm done, but for now, this is pretty good. Anyway, good good good good good good good good good good good Bye. For now, anyways.

Yo what up my Bros. I'm gonna just write about things cause I'm sdumb. Anyway, did you guys catch the various spelling errors in the last entry? No?? Well, I DID!!!!! If you don't know what I'm talking about, let me give you some examples such as "sentances", "Of coruse", and best of all, "langauge". Anyway, enough talking about my spelling errors. I have made a new textface. You don't know what a textface is? What kind of person- no... THING are you??!? How could you not know what a textface is?!?!??! It's alright, I will educate you on the beauty of textfaces. Basically, just emojis but not. That's it. Anyway, here's the face I made. (:_-_:) There it is!!! Oh, what's it supposed to be? Uh, I dunno. I just made it. Give me a break, okay!?!?!?!? Thanks for giving me a break for about 2.713 seconds. Okay, I'm starting to get bored now... I want to go home... To do nothing... For 6 hours... Yeah... OH!!! WAIT!!!!! I KNOW WHAT TO TALK ABOUT!!!!!!!! So, remember last entry that I was talking about my friend translating the WhileTrue message? Yeah, he´s doing a better translation now! Just go onto his website (link in the LTE Hub, Pink-ish Pickle LTE) and scroll down to the entry that says "More WhileTrue translation!!" and you'll see it!! Anyway, it's, uh, Tuesday now. Yeah, I started writing this entry on Monday, but I ran out of time yesterday to finish this, so I decided I would write more tomorrow (which is today). So, I now have more time to write about anything I want. Oh, I should probably talk about this thing I'm adding. If you read the last entry (the whole thing), you would know that I'm adding a new thing to the website. I'm adding a dedicated rules page!! To making LTEs!!! Which also includes a tutorial on how to make LTEs!!!! It's going to take a while, cause I'm lazy, and cause I need to make a video for the tutorial, and also cause I'm lazy (again). Anyway, I'm going to type the font letters now. Aa. I did it!!! I am So Cool(trademark maybe). What do I talk about now... I think I might need to consult that conversation starter website... Or a doctor... I have a terrible headache... Which is because I haven't ate anything in the past 4 hours... Which is actually 12 hours cause I slept 8 hours before waking up... Okay, I'll stop that now. Maybe... Okay kids, the moral of this story is to GO TO THE PINK-Ish PICKLE LTE!!!!!! Or else the Pie God will come and Make You into a pie. Yeah, that's right, he's BACK. The holy Pie God. He has returned to eat some children!! Which, actually, are just pies. But STILL!!! Children pies nonetheless! Oh, wait, I forgot, I killed off the Pie God in Episode 13. Yeah, rest in peace Pie God, you may or may not be missed... I'm so Not Enjoyed. So, y'know what? I'm just gonna play the snake game, because I'm Not Enjoyed at all. So, uh, I guess this is goodbye for now... It was nice meeting you... Actually, I have no idea who you are... Ok Bye !

Hey, so, I just wanted to update this because I'm bored. Yeah, that's it. Anyway, what was I going to talk about...? Oh, right. So, a thing I like to do to pass the time (because I'm in that boring class again) is to go onto the Google Support website, go to the community tab, and just look at the various funny posts that are on there. Most of these "funny" posts mostly consist of people talking nonsense or spelling words very wrong. You guys should go check it out sometimes, it's very Fun ! Anyway, onto my point. So, as I was looking at the posts, I noticed in the top right of my screen that I had a profile. So, I decided to see what my profile was. Turns out, my name on the Google Support forum is "pictuer wallper". Yes, like I said before, these are very funny posts. So, as soon as I seen my name, I knew it was from a post on this forum. So, I decided to search for it. I've looked far and wide for this post and finally, after all these years... I have found it. The origin of my name on the Google Support forum. You may be wondering, "Well, where is it???!?!??!?!" To answer that question, first, can you be quiet!??!?!? You'll wake up, uh, my dad... Yeah... Because I forgot... That the Pie God is dead... Anyway, if you want to look at the post for yourself, then take this link... Anyway, that's pretty much it now, because I'm so bored that I can't write any longer... At least I have school off tomorrow... OH!!! Also, the Pink-ish Pickle LTE updated again, with more WhileTrue translation. Link in the LTE Hub!!!! Anyway, that's it. Cya ..

Nearly a week since I last updated this... and I'm still not dead!! Wow, isn't that interesting? Okay, maybe not, but still. You guys gotta commend me for living this long without updating my LTE! After all, if I don't update this... Nothing will happen. Uh, yeah. I was going to say "I won't exist anymore...", BUUUUT that's not true. So, that's right, it is time, to update, my LTE, once more. Yeah, the reason why... actually, do I have to explain why I'm updating my LTE everytime I write a new entry? It's not like I'm supposed to be doing something important, right...? Hahahaha... okay yeah maybe i shouldnt be updating this because i have about 407 assignments not turned in BUT I Don't Care. Anyway, what was I going to talk about again? Oh, right. So, about the rule/tutorial page I was working on... Well, it's still being worked on because I'm lazy. Also probably because I have more important things to do than to update this website... But hey, this is MY project, MY life, I get to choose what I do with it. Unless my parents find out and tell me to delete the website... Which most likely won't happen. But still, it could... Anyway, what else to talk about? Uh, I guess I could talk about what I should be working on. So, it's a science assignment. Uh, yeah, that's all I'm going to tell you. Actually, you know what? I'll write this entry AND do the assignment at the same time!! What could go wrong!!! Alright, I have the document loaded and I'm just gonna do that while I'm thinking of things to write for this entry. OH!! I should also mention that the counter for the end of the world has now reached below 2,500 days!!! Wow that's actually not good at all!!!! We're all going to die in less than 2,500 days!!!!! Anyway, enough about that, cause who cares about the end of the world? Nobody, that's for sure... Also, I'm still working on that assignment. Yeah, it's actually less boring than I thought it would be. Here's an interesting thing about me. For some reason, I like writing essays. Why? I dunno. Well, I guess it depends on how fun the topic is. I guess I like science... But, I probably won't be fully invested in it to get a job. Also, my arm feels warm for some reason... Do I have some sort of disease!!?! Probably not, but it's still concerning. Maybe I should go to the doctor... Maybe I won't have to go to school... Eh, it's probably nothing, even though I really don't want to be here right now. Actually, no. For some reason, I feel kind of excited about today. Why? Again, I have no idea. Why am I asking all of these "why" questions if I don't know the answer...? Oh no, I just asked another one!!! Anyway, I can't really think of anything else to write, and I also need to work on that assignment before my 3rd period, so I'm ending this entry here. Thanks for watching please like and subscribe for more LTE entries!!!

Hey!!! You!!! I'm updating this again!!! So read this!!! Anyway, Hi!!!!!! It's me, that one person that does things on that website. So, you may be wondering why I'm updating this... And if you thought I was going to say, "Cause I was bored lolololo", well... YOU'RE WRONG!!!! Yeah, that's right, I actually have a valid reason for updating this website on November 22nd, 2021! So, you may be wondering, "Well, if you're so confident you have a valid reason, then what IS it, hm???????" Well, I'll tell you... After 2494 days, 13 hours, 52 minutes and 11 seconds. Okay, not really, I'm not waiting until the end of the world to tell you the reason, so I'll just get to the point, cause I've stalled long enough. Plus, I don't really have much time left... In this class, anyway. Alright, so, do you guys remember that thing that I worked on for about a week and then abandoned? Yeah, the Archives. The thing that was supposed to make my entries into a more readable format without giving someone a stroke once they saw the length of this page. Anyway, you guys also remember the Flaming Chickens LTE? Yeah, the LTE that basically started all of this. You probably know what I'm leading up to based on the context given... but I'll just lead up to it more because we need dramatic tension!! Anyway, I was just reading through some LTEs. I then decided to go to Flaming Chickens' LTE because... I was bored... Of course... Anyway, I saw this little thing on the top of the page called "Table of Contents". BUUUT, all except one of the links didn't work, and that one link was to go to the introduction of the LTE... So, I decided to look through more of the Flaming Chickens website by removing "abcd.html" from the link. I looked through the main page, and scrolled down to the News section. Read through that, until I found an update that interested me. It stated, "July 12th: "Meg" has finally done her guest rant! It's about how Barbie prepares us for Reality TV! Go to the LTE for more info!" Now, the stuff that the update stated didn't interest me, but it was actually the "LTE" link (the word LTE was a link). What I found had very much shocked me... It was... It was... IT WAS...! A more complete list of the Table of Contents. However, that didn't really shock me. What REALLY shocked me was that when I clicked on an entry on that page... It was the same format that I used for the Archives!! That's right, Flaming Chickens had done the Archives idea 16 years before me... and I DIDN'T KNOW!!!!!!!!! Please believe me, I swear I didn't know I was copying Flaming Chickens... I promise!! Oh, right, I should probably link the page where I found this at, so it doesn't seem like I'm crazy... So here, take it!!! See how much better it is than my copied version... Even though I seriously didn't know that Flaming Chickens had done this idea before I did. Also, remember when I said it was a more complete version of the Table of Contents? Yeah, what I mean by "more complete" is that one entry was added to it (yeah I know there's more that are clickable but they don't work DON'T YELL AT ME). But hey, at least it's something! Hmm, maybe I should complete it myself... Eh, maybe I will when I get the time, which will probably be never because the grind of education is more important!!! Even though it's boring... Anyway, I only have about 10 minutes left in my current period right now, so I'll end this, send the notification, (reminder to if you want notifications when the LTE is updated, click the link at the top of the page!!!!!) and do something better with my life!!! Alright, I'm going to sleep... Good night... Or day...

Wow... 8 days have passed since I last updated this... That sure is a long time!!!!!! Anyway, uh, just updating this because, y'know, that, yeah, yup, okay, I don't want this website to literally die!!! Sorry, if my sentences, grammar, or other stuffs don't make sense. My brain is kind of not working right now... Because I'm tired, Very tired. Why??? I don 't know ? Help y7777777777777777777777777777777777 SOrry. Yeah, as you can see, uh, my brain is Not Responding, Please Try Again Later (Error 402). So, what shall I talk about while I'm technically high??? Stuff and things... Ye ye *&^%! Sorry, again, brain is not working. Uh, so, I should probably talk about what I'm adding to the website, because I'm adding something to the website, because This is Something I'M ADDING to the Website! (Not Click baiit) Alright, if you've ever been to thhe Flaming Chickns website, then you MUST know about the "undefined". Oh, osrry, I ment the Javascript Kit that Flaming Chickens used. Yeah, y'know that?? Well, I've since discovered that Javascript is VERSY COOL!!! Yeah, cause with Javascript, you can do a LOTTA THINS!!! One problem, however. I don't know how to code in Javascript... You may be wondering, "Well, how'd you do the End Of The World counter, eh?????" Well, if you'd look through the source code of my website, you'd know that I stole it... I put a note there saying "I stole this countdown script..." in the script tag of the countdown. Yeah, that's right, I STOLE IT!!!! What are YOU gonna do about it?? ...Right , I forgot that I can't hear you... But anyway, back on topic. So, I went to the Javascript Kit website and I found a lot of COOL SCRIPTS!!! I found things from counters and calendars to whatever "Ajax scripts" are!! Yeah, very cool. In fact, I'm thinking of using some of those scripts on my website... For extra coolness, of course. Not for anything SECRET or anything... I would NEVER do something like that... But, I am adding some stuffs, so make sure to subscribe and to ring that bell for notifications!!! Okay, I can't thin k of anythin g else to write, and my brain is overheating from too much thinking!! so Yeah, bye

Hey, yo, whaddup, It me. So. I have something. That YOU. Need. To. See. We have made an AMAZING DISCOVERY!!!! Oh, what is this discovery, you may be asking? Well, we have found... A NEW LTE!!! Well, actually... I didn't do anything. It was my friend, y'know, the Pink-ish Pickle guy, owner of the Pink-ish Pickle LTE and Pink-ish Pickle LLC, a home-owned company entirely dedicated to making... uh... actually, nevermind. I made that last part up... ANYWAY, he found the new LTE. So I decided to take a look, and see if maybe someone else other than us two are still active in the LTE community!! ...It was last updated in 2012. Well, that was a failure... BUT STILL!! It's still exciting finding a new LTE!! Oh, wait, SHOOT!! I gotta go! Because my next class is starting in 5 minutes! And I haven't ate lunch yet!!! Okay, I'm going to do that!! So I don't die!! Bye!!!

Hey Guys, Welcome Back To Another Minecraft Lets Play, Today We Will Be Dying Successfully. Make sure to Die and Yeah... Okay, yeah, you already know what time it is... Time to talk about Whatever!!! Alright, I actually have something prepared to talk about instead of just going off of my head for ideas. Today, I'm going to be talking about a very powerful series of Google Documents that take up about 99.9% of Google's storage. A series so powerful... that even my friend and I... and nearly 50 OTHER PEOPLE were apart of it at some point in this current timeline... You may not know what I'm talking about, and that's fine. I didn't really expect you to know if I don't even know who you are... So, I'll tell you. This legendary series of documents was named, "The End Of The World". Now, I'm just stating off from what I recall from my memory, so some stuff may be incorrect, so please forgive me as I have some sort of memory loss... I think? Yeah, probably. ANYWAY, on to the actual story of The End Of The World. Alright, from what I recall, it started before COVID became BIG and BAD and I DON'T LIKE IT status... Actually, I think this was before COVID started to spread, even... I have no idea... All I recall is that it was started sometime in 2020. I think it was either just slightly before or after I made my LTE website, which is this website!! Anyway, my friend (the Pink-ish Pickle guy, who is very cool and you should go to his LTE NOW!!!! Link in LTE Hub...) and I discovered the art of LTEs. So, we decided to make something similar to that in a Google Doc. I think what really pushed the idea (to make it in a Google Doc) was after we had found this document I made in Google Docs in April of 2019, before we had found the Flaming Chickens LTE and I think before I had even met my friend... The document I'm talking about was called "this is e[pic". Do you want to guess how many pages the document is? About 380. Well, it wasn't 380 before I had discovered the Flaming Chickens LTE... I think it was 100 or something like that, which consisted of the entire United States Constitution translated into Russian. Then I added the entire FC LTE into the document, which increased the page count to 380. Actually, I think I added it in twice... Anyway, now onto the good stuff. The first version of The End Of The World. Alright, I don't really remember much of the document as 1. It was quite a long time ago and 2. The original document seems to be deleted, or I just can't find it... So, I can't really fact check anything. Anyway, version 1. I remember that my friend made it in our science class, and invited our tablemates to the document as well, who were kind of our friends, but, uh... I can't really explain it well... I guess saying they were passive-aggressive to us most of the time fits, right? Probably... Anyway, that first document was a VERY FUN TIME!!! Really, I had a lot of fun playing with that document. We even managed to crash our Chromebooks... What we did most of the time was spam-paste the document with various phrases and words to... try and make the document as long as possible. Well, me and my friend were doing that, while the other tablemates... they were trying to DELETE IT!!!! Our hard work would've gone down the drain!! Well, based on the fact that I can't find the document now... maybe they were successful. Actually, yeah, I think that's actually what happened. I think when you have the editor permission on a Google Doc, you can just outright delete the whole document... Which is a HORRIBLE IDEA!!! Please change this Google... I don't want MY hard work being deleted by some random person! Anyway, that's all I can remember for the first version, so lets move to version 2. Anyway, version 2 was the version that included just under 50 people on a single document... Yeah, sounds cool, right?? Well, it was. Although I wasn't on the editing team... Yeah, I know, it sucked!!! What a way to disrespect someone who worked on the original document!!!!! At least my friend got into the editing team... But anyway, instead of this version being solely about spam-pasting random things, it was actually sort of a chatroom. Also, I'll mention that the document is not owned by my friend that made the first one, but my other friend, who got inspired by the first version... well, I think, at least. Again, like I said before, I might get some things wrong, as my memory isn't the most reliable thing... Anyway, the second document did still have some elements of the original document, but like I said, it was also sort of a chatroom as well. It was awesome!!! It had like an update feed, which was updated based on both what was happening in the document and in real life. Also, apparently, the original document was my friends (not the Pink-ish Pickle guy) math notes... Nice!! Anyway, remember that un-true LTE that I don't update anymore? Yeah, both "THE END GOAL OF LIFE IS DEATH", "GUESS WHOS BACK", and "1½ egg" are all from The End Of The World 2! It all comes full circle... Anyway, that's all I can remember for EOTW 2, so lets move to the final version, The End Of The World 3. So, version 3 is the shortest of the 3 versions. Basically, it was just a chatroom for the first 10 or so pages. Then, the rest consisted of "S H E D" spam... Yeah, I'd say the third version was the most boring. In fact, I'm getting bored of writing this!! I wanna code!!! Not write a story!!!! So, I think I'll end this here. But, after a few things. First, this entire story has encouraged me to make something special... BUT!!! I'll be releasing it at a very specific and interesting date. I've changed the end of the world counter to countdown until this date. Don't worry, I'll change it back to what it was after the date passes. This is only for now... and, if I have to say, the countdown text is very fitting for what I'm making. You probably know what I'm making, but I won't reveal it officially just yet!! Anyway, I'm going to post this now and work on the thing I'm making... I'll still be updating this however, just going to be working on that thing I'm making instead of adding new things to the website, which means the Javascript thing will have to wait. Or maybe I'll do it anyway... Ok good bye (goodbye)

Hey there, sorry for not updating this in a while. Just a lot of school stuff... y'know, homework. Bad grades also! It sucks.... Well, kind of. The classes are pretty fun, but the assignments aren't. But hey, I guess that's what homework does to ya. Anyway, I don't have much time so I'll just get to the point. I found TWO NEW LTES!!! Yeah, that's right, and this time it wasn't my friend, the Pink-ish Pickle guy, that did all the work. It was ME!!! I finally did something useful for once! Imagine that!! Anyway, they're both on Neocities, so if you want to see them it shouldn't be hard to find them using the search function on Neocities. OOORRR, you can go to my LTE Hub and access them more quickly! So, go do that!! Give me more money!!! Even though I don't even have advertisements on this site... or that I can even make an account to receive money.... But still, go check it out, it's pretty cool -totally non biased review by not me. Ha... ha ha. Anyway, uh, I'm probably going to be YELLED AT in my next period for not finishing an assignment, so I'll end it here so you guys don't have to suffer the pain I do!! Anyway, g' bye, or some other goodbye phrase here...

3 weeks... kinda a long time, eh Luigi? Yeah, sure IS!!!! Anyway, hello, hey, Hi, How are you? Welcome back to this little website in some corner of the internet... Also, happy 2022! Hopefully this year things don't go as badly as 2021 did, or maybe even 2020... Only time shall tell...! Anyway, I guess I have some extra time so I'll talk about somethings. Y'know that thing I'm working on, that's coming out in about 3 months according to the End of the World timer? Yeah, still working on it! I'm not going to reveal anything about the thing I'm working on, but I'm mostly sure that you'll enjoy it! Also, just a small warning, I wouldn't recommend going to the thing I'm making on a not very powerful device, as it'll take a LONG time to load. So, try to go on it on a powerful device, like a good deskop or something (although I personally use a COOL EPIC GAMING laptop, cause my family can't really afford a good desktop computer...). Anyway, uh, that's pretty much it, I don't really have much time left until my next class, so I'll end it here. Hopefully I update this later...

Oh my god I can't send notifcations anymore!!!!!!!! WHat the Cheese (queso)!!!!!!!!!!

What's up bros, it's me. Today I'm gonna fix my website!! Specifically the push notification thing since, for some reason, it won't let me send a push notification because it thinks that I have no subscribers. Which I don't, cause I have at least one subscriber, and that's ME!!!!! ON MY PHONE!!!!!!!!!!! But, for some reason, it thinks otherwise, SOOOO... I'm gonna try to put the Google push notification thing in here... even though the website I need to generate the keys is blocked on my Chromebook... Why? I DON'T KNOW!!!!!!! But, anyway, I'm gonna use my phone in cooperation with my Chromebook to try to do this, as my actual computer is... well... let's just say I had a little conflict with my parents and I can't use it right now. Yeah... Okay, I'm gonna try this, so I might make updates in between to tell you guys if I've done it or not... or I might not!!! Who knows... Ok bye

Okay, so, I kinda gave up on the whole notification thing, as I have other things to worry about... Like, uh... okay maybe I was just lazy. But hey, I still have other things to talk about...! I have no idea where I'm going with this entry, but I'm just gonna spit out thoughts in my Brain ! Oh, wait, the class is over in nearly 2 minutes... Welp, I guess I gotta make this QUICK!!! So, you may have been wondering, "Hey, why are all the recent entries very short and weird?" Well.., to answer that, it's because, y'know, but first we need to thank our sponsor... or something like that. Ya get what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah... Anyway, today as my mom was driving me to my School house place... We heard this little thing on the radio. Basically, our local radio station does this thing where people can contact them if either they think their spouse is cheating on them, or someone they went on a date with isn't calling them back, we heard the later. Basically, this guy wondered why this girl he went on a date with wasn't calling him back, or just even talking to him in general... And once the radio people got a hold of her, y'know what her reason was? It's because the GUY was using too many exclamation marks in his texts!!!! Yeah, can you imagine that? Someone refusing to talk to the other just because they use too many exclamation marks... And then they got into a BIG ARGUMENT on why using too many exclamation marks is a turn-off... I was just sitting there, wondering, "WHO CARES!!!!!!!!" It's literally just exclamation marks, and refusing to date someone over something as SIMPLE as THAT is absolutely one of the STUPIDEST things I've ever heard in my life... Seriously, and I'm not just talking about this because it applies to me, cause I use a lot of exclamation marks to be, uh, "Funny and Friendly!!!" It's because it's just a really stupid thing to argue about. If people every single day act like this, then I don't know where this world is going... If you get what I mean... Sorry, I'm not very good at word things... ANYWAY, kind of a tone shift, but I'm done with talking about that, and now I'm talking about THAT!! So, recently, I've been playing this very small, unknown game... Well, it's not THAT small, but literally no one I know talks about it, so YeAH!!!!! Anyway, the games called VVVVVV. It's Very Great, I Approve! 420/10! haha Weed number, anyway... Yeah, I've been really enjoying the game a lot. Been playing it on this very small, unknown console called the PS Vita. Yeah, very small, nobody knows about it except for ME!!! cause I work at Sony Entertainment. Actually, I don't, that's a lie, please don't sue me Sony. Yeah, the PS Vita, it's quite the underrated handheld. But, I don't use it for JUST the games. No... i use it for JAILBREAKING!!! I jailbroke my PS Vita, so now I can do things no other PS Vita owner can do before... PIRATE GAMES!!!!! Actually, I don't do that. Well, kind of? I buy the games on my computer first to support the developer, THEN I pirate the game for the PS VIta. Because, y'know, I already OWN IT!!! But still, buy it on the other consoles too, support the developers!! Just like what I did for my 502 copies of Minecraft on every platform ever... Okay, back to the game now. So, VVVVVV is know to be a very HARD game. And, I agree with that! Well, it isn't VERY hard, just regular hard. I can still beat the game, but after I get around 256 deaths or so. Yeah, not good, AT ALL!!!!! Still, I enjoy it. I've recently been doing the time trials, as I read on a guide thing on Steam that practicing those time trials can get you better at the game, and y'know what? It's working! Haha, finally!! I'm getting good at something!!! My parents were wrong when they said that I would never be good at anything in my life!! So, take THAT, parents! Anyway, I'd recommend you try VVVVVV if you like platformers. I sure do!!!! Also, the music is a BOP!!!!!! So yeah, if you like music too, then CHECK-IT-OUT!!!!! Well, I feel like I want to talk more, but I can't think of anything else. Good night =)

Hola amigos, bienvenidos a mi casa, hoy lo haremos.

Hey hey, probably won't be a real entry today, so here's some filler content. It's very Funny!! Yeah

Hi GUys, sorry for taking a week break from updating this. I had to stay home all of last week for a reason that I shall not mention because uhhhhhhhhhh Ok. Don't worry, I don't have covid or anything, it was a one time thing and I don't think it'll happen again. Which is good, as I don't really work well away from school cause I get distracted pretty easily. Actually, that's one of the main reasons why I started this website! Because I get distracted easily and instead of doing my work as I should, I update this!! Anyway, I started semester two today, so all of my grades basically reset. So, from now on, I'll make a "promise" to myself that I won't Die (school-wise). But, to be honest, that won't follow throughout the whole year, I Know it...! Anyway, I don't know, I possibly don't care... I have no idea what I'm talking about! So yeag. I am so bored that even writing this is getting boring!! Anyway, I'm yeah and you're Watching Vsop. =) yeah this is it for today as I am tired and I want to go sleep and eat Butter Cookies ::::)

Gello, what hup. Im gonan Yes. and ure wasging Didney canal. Okay, I have no idea what I'm talking about, maybe I'm going crazy or something, so I think I'll stop that now. Anyway, Hi! Sure has been a little bit, hasn't it? Well, kind of, it's only been like what, 4 days? I mean, that's still kind of long, but I've gone longer without updatng this... Oh god, I just had a flashback to the 6 month break I had back in 2020... Yeah, hopefully that doesn't happen again! I only plan to make a mutliple month-long break during summer, as I don't go to school during those months. I've pretty much made up an un-official rule to only update this when I'm at school... I don't know why I decided to do this, but it's basically what I've been doing ever since I started this. So, yeah!!!! Anyway, on a completely different topic, I noticed a small error in the end of the world countdown. I originally planned it to end at noon, which is 12:00 PM if you didn't know, but I had a small programming error in which it would end at midnight, which is 12:00 AM if you didn't know. Well, it was actually closer to 1 AM, as it was set for 12:59 AM, but that's beside the point. There's a reason why I mentioned that made up rule in the last... uh... sentence? Is that how you explain it? I dunno, but you get what I'm saying, right? Anyway, if I'm going to stick with that rule, I can't have the timer going out when I'm not at school, cause I won't be able to update it, since that rule is in place. Well, I could always just break that rule and update it at home instead, but NO!!! That's less fun and it reduces my time to do whatever I want at home, instead of working on this. It's not like I don't like working on this website, I do, really! It's just that I see this as more as a project kind of? Well, more so a school project, even though I've never shown anyone this except for my friend, the Pink-ish Pickle guy. Literally only he knows about this... nobody else. Well, at least, that's what I think. Maybe someone else in my school knows about this website... but hey, I can't really know for sure. Anyway, uh, I think that's it for today? I really have nothing else to talk about, so I'll just end it here for now. Cheesy queso!!!!!

Just wanted to make a quick update. I just got out of PE and guess what?!?! The class played "Take a Chance" and I got second place!!!! Hell YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!

Hey, what's up third or fourth update this week YEAH!!!! ANyway, yes, welcome. Just updating this cause I'm bored. Currently in that one boring class that I mentioned a few entries ago. Y'know, about like doing projects and stuff? Yeah... that... basically our group completed our work early and we're just sitting here. Well, except for these two that are talking about movies or something. I think they're friends... Only another person and I are just sitting here, doing absolutely nothing!!!! So, instead of just sitting in this wooden chair, doing nothing to contribute to society, I decided to update this again! But, the real question is, what will I talk about. I dunno. That's all I have to say. Well, cya!!!! just kiding xDDDDDDDDDDDD!!! Yeah, I'm not actually going, because I need to fufill my time requirement for this class, or else I will probably go to jail! So... yeah... yup... Okay, this is way less interesting than I thought it would be. Will I need to consult the conversation starter website again????? Hopefully not. Oh, right, about that project that I'm releasing in a month... yeah I haven't got any work done on it since around early January... oh my friend is on the document right now. Nice!!! So yeah, if you're reading this, HI!!!!!!!! Anyway, I guess I'll keep the document open for now. Hmm... OH!!! I also completely forgot about that LTE rules page that I was working on. Yeah, I guess I'm still working on that as well. But, I'm planning for it to have a more unique look than the rest of these webpages, or something. Maybe I will just make it look like every other page on here, I dunno. Also, I tried to type of the document, but the thing is... It's so long that even typing one letter will literally freeze the entire webpage and take about 4 minutes to update. I'm currently trying to transcribe the entire United States Constitution translated to Russian into the document, but Google Translate is crashing prematurely... Well, I'm going to end this here now. Not because I don't want to keep writing, but I kind of need the extra resources on my chromebook. So, I'm going to close all of the tabs that I don't need. SO yeah, Bye Bye good

Higuys, today I'm going to make a little page for all of the Funny Games i've found. This is probably going to get my website blocked from the school proxies, but hey, I can just make another version of this website without the games page. Yeah!!! oky here we go

what Up, i complete The Game page. So Yeah, check it at top of Page =)

Okay, I've removed the games page, because it just seemed like a stupid idea and I was basically begging to get blocked, so yeah. I honestly don't know why I did make the games page, I guess I was just so bored that I decided to do delusional things in order to get excited. So yeah, never doing that again... probably. Anyway, I may or may not update this, I don't know. I'm kind of getting burnt out on updating this so I may take a small break. Yeah, BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hey, just wanted to tell you guys that I'm not dead, just bored. yeah that's it Goobye

Actually, I've changed my mind, I guess I'll write some more cause I have nothin' better to do. So, what's there to say? I've just been bored out of my mind these past few weeks and I haven't really felt like updating this. Usually if I feel bored then I would update this, but even that's gotten boring. My friend hasn't updated his LTE in 3 weeks, so I guess I've just adopted that too. No offense to him though, I get it. We've been doing this for nearly 2 years at this point... Y'know, I was expecting for this to last until I graduated from high school, but it looks like I'm already at that point where I just don't feel like updating this anymore. Jeez, that sentence sounded like I was depressed or something... Don't worry, I'm not. I guess I'm just using some edgy wording. I honestly don't know what I'm going to do with this website after I release that thing that's coming out in 9 days. Hell, I don't even know what to say! I guess my mind's going blank trying to come up with words to write. Maybe it's because I'm hungry...? Probably. Yeah, I can't think of anything else to say. I thought I was going to say something, then my mind just pushes it out of my memory. Does that ever happen to you? It happens to me a lot... and it's ANNOYING!!! Seriously, I try to say something, then I just can't. Do I have some sort of mental disorder or something? Maybe... Well, I do have a disability, kind of. Not really with my brain (though that's unconfirmed), but rather with my feet. Basically, I can't walk normally. There's this muscle in the legs of a human called the "achilles tendon". It's a muscle that allows you to... uh. I don't really know how to explain it, so I'll just copy and paste from WebMD. "The Achilles tendon is a tough band of fibrous tissue that connects the calf muscles to the heel bone (calcaneus). The Achilles tendon is the largest and strongest tendon in the body. When the calf muscles flex, the Achilles tendon pulls on the heel. This movement allows us to stand on our toes when walking, running, or jumping." Thanks WebMD. Anyway, turns out that the tendon on both legs is too short, causing me to constantly stand and walk on my toes. Y'know, I have this feeling that I've already told you guys that I have a condition like this... maybe I did. I dunno, but I'm just gonna explain it here anyway. This condition prevents me from doing a lot of basic exercises and greatly reduces my stamina in my legs, meaning that if I stand/walk for too long, my feet start to hurt. A lot. Well, it depends on how long I stand/walk, but it starts hurting bad pretty fast. I'd say about 25-30 minutes is when I start to feel a lot of pain. I have to constantly sit down to rest my legs, even if it's on the ground. I tried to get it fixed a few years ago, through surgery, but that didn't work. I could try getting surgery again, but I don't think that'll have a good impact on my grades, as I would have to stay home for a few weeks or so. It sucks knowing that I might never get this fixed, and I might just stay like this for the rest of my life, which as I might add, has a very bad effect on my back. I'm only in high school, and I'm already having back problems!!!! Anyway, this went on longer than I expected, but that's good. I said that I was expecting this website to last until I graduate, and if I keep going on rambles like this, then that might just be a possiblity. Anyway, that's it for now. Goobye for real (i think)

Hey, I added a dark mode option in request of my friend. I'm also planning to add a system that remembers if you enabled dark mode or not so that it would apply to other pages on this website. But, I need to research all about cookies, which is kind of complicated. So, I'll try to add something like that, but I can't guarentee that it will be added. Anyway, that's it. Bye

Wow! I'm actually updating this on the first day of the week!! Nice!!! Anyway, yeah, another update. Just wanted to talk about some things. Such as, my spanish teacher. Yeah, I'm going to talk about my spanish teacher. Mhm, yeah, talking about my spanish teacher now. Yup................. okay I'll talk now. Anyway, about her, she acts in a very interesting way. Sometimes, she talks in this tone of voice like she's very pushy about us not answering questions. It's not that we don't want to, it's just that sometimes we don't understand. But she seems to think that we know everything about the Spanish language and that we know how to perfectly speak it. Truth is, we don't. We're only in spanish 1. It'd make sense if she acted that way if we were in spanish 2, as we should know some about the language, but we're not. So, she gets very pushy and keeps repeating the same questions in an annoyed tone of voice thinking that'll make us understand the question. But, the truth is, I know she isn't trying to be rude to us. It's really just the way she talks when she teaches, and a lot of people (myself included) get the impression that she's mad at us for not understanding sometimes. But, she isn't. Well, I don't think so at least. She's actually very nice, I've talked to her outside of class and she's a nice person. Sure, she still has that tone of voice, but that's just the way she talks. So, the real question is, if I made the conclusion that she's a nice person, then why did I even make this whole thing explaining why she has that annoyed tone of voice to begin with? Well, I have no idea. I just wanted to uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Write. Anyway, I found this funny thing that you should look at also why is my chromebook telling me to update my software I will not go away now ok bye here's the thing I wanted you to look at yeah

Hi hi, today I want to celebrate getting 5,000 hits on my website! Nice! Yeah, very cool. I literally have nothing else to say other than the thing that I keep procrastinating to work on as it literally won't work on my chromebook releases in 2 days.... and I'm not even half way done with it!!!!!!!! Well, that's it for today, as I can't think of anything else to say. So yeah, bbbbbbbbbbbye.

Wow, I actually did something for the LTE's birthday!! Yup, that's right, today is March 4th, 2022, the same day I created my LTE. Oh, also happy birthday to the Pink-ish Pickle LTE as well. Anyway, in collaboration with the Pink-ish Pickle guy, original co-creator of the first End of the World, we have released THE End of the World Part 4!!!!!!! It's at the bottom of the page. Anyway, I guess I'll talk about it. I wanted to do something nostalgic for the second LTE birthday, y'know, something to bring back old memories... I thought it was fair to do part 4 for the birthday as it basically kickstarted this entire thing, so yeah. I can't really think of anything else to say here, so just read the document, it'll give you some more info. Anyway, I guess I'll just talk about some random stuff now to fill my character quota for the day. I currently got some Pringles (sour cream and onion) and I may be the only person in the world that likes sour cream and onion flavored chips. I have never met another person in my entire life that like sour cream and onion chips, except for myself. If you like sour cream and onion chips, make sure to give me a Facebook follow on 70 alternative accounts! Haha, just kidding, I don't use Facebook. Anyway, I need to focus on my math class now. CYA!!!!!!!

Hey Hey What Up! Today im gona talk about my my. What is a my my? Well, I dounno. I just made it Up! Alright, if you couldn't tell, I'm very bored... Like, VERY VERY bored. I'm currently in PE right now but instead of playing games, we're supposed to make a game. I don't think we'll actually play them though, it's just for this assignment. So, all of us are just here, sitting on the ground, on our Chromebooks. Everyone else seems pretty occupied either talking with their friends, making up a game, or both. While me, well, I'm just sitting here, all by myself, because I know literally nobody in this class... Literally no one. At all. Which explains why I'm so bored. I have NOBODY!!! To talk to... So yeah, I guess I've just been messing around on my Chromebook for the last hour and 10 minutes? I think that's how long it's been... Anyway, My other class begins in around 8 minutes, so hopefully I can just fill up that time while I write, because I don't want to be here anymore. It's boring and I'm highly confident that my next class (the last one of the day) is around 100,000 times more fun that this. Supposedly, we're going to watch the first 25 minutes of the first Ghostbusters! YEah!!!!!! We're doing a film unit in my English class, which is my next class, and it's actually kind of fun. I just overheard a conservation that this person in my class went to the next class by us and played PE games with middle schoolers. Man, I wish I could've done that. It would've been a Lot Of Fun!!!!! Or something like that. Oh, I know what to talk about! I don't really get the hate against middle schoolers from high schoolers. I mean, yeah, they can be kind of annoying, but they're middle schoolers, do you really expect them to be as mature as you? I personally Don't Think So! I've had quite a lot of fun experiences with people younger than me. In fact, I think it's more fun with people younger than me. They have this sense of carelessness that I admire. They could literally do anything they'd want, and they would get away with it most of the time. I wish I was like that when I was younger, but unfortunately, I was... a LOSER!!!!! And I still kind of am. But hey, at least I'm not completely hated by the entire school, I have some friends!! And y'know what? I think it's better to only have a few friends then like 9 or 10 friends in a single group. Anyway, my time's up now. I might talk some more later, but I dunno, only time shall tell. Anyway, Boy Boy Bye Bye

So, do you remember way long ago I tried to implement that uh... hold on, let me pull up the title for it... ah right. It's The Experimental Music Player Thing That I Haven't Fully Worked Out Yet But Maybe I Will Sometime In The Future, I Don't Know™! So yeah, basically I reimplemented that thing into my website and I finally know how to properly center it this time! Turns out, the answer was a lot easier than I thought it was. For some reason, I originally tried to center the player only using the margin tag...? Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking, but basically I literally just put the iframe in a center tag and it just automatically centered the player for me. Yeah, literally THAT EASY!!!!!! And for some reason, I didn't even think of doing that like... around 1 and a half years ago. I don't know the exact date, but it was somewhere around there. Anyway, the class I'm in is really short, so I'll have to stop here. uhhh I can't think of a proper ending so yeah this is the ending

Wow, I'm bored and I only have 5 minutes left in my class. Well, guess I'll just say some stuff! Actually, I can't think of anything to say. So

Alright, I've finally discovered something to write about! So, let me give some backstory first. So, in my school district, there's this website that a student made that basically hosts a lot of "unblocked" websites and games. What I mean by "unblocked" is that, with our school district, and probably any other school district, they use a proxy for all of our devices provided by the schools to block access to websites that have games and whatnot. Basically, just things that may distract students from doing their work. Anyway, this website, as I said before, was a hub for a lot of unblocked websites and games one couldn't usually access with just the standard settings on our device. Anyway, you may be wondering why I'm talking about this. Well, this website has had a history for being blocked by our proxy, to then being unblocked, and then being blocked again. It was pretty much an loop between those things for around 2-3 years. Anyway, today, I've just discovered that the proxy has basically permanently blocked the website. But how? Well, before the website creator would be able to unblock the website by just changing a number in the domain URL. An example of this would be a domain URL such as "coolguy1.org" to "coolguy2.org". How the creator did this is just by either creating a new website or changing the existing one using some sort of method in the service they were using, which was Replit. Now, I've never used Replit before, so I don't know how one would go about changing the domain name or creating a new website, but I can probably assume it was quite easy based on the speed of which the website was reappearing. Either that, or they had a lot of money to throw away on new domains. However, instead of the proxy just blocking that specific domain, the administrators instead decided to just block any website with, what I'm guessing, the main name of the website, followed by a hyphen and any number. Because I tried numbers 1-999 and all of them were blocked. In fact, I'm pretty sure I know the way they did it, but I just can't really explain it. It has something to do with the exclusion feature in certain proxies, which you can block a website domain that has some sort of prefix or subfix, such as coolguy.neocities.org or neocities.coolguy.org, in which the name "neocities" would be blocked, so neither of those websites would be accessible within the proxy. Or something like that, I've never really messed around with a proxy. However, I do know how to get a list of SOME websites that either go through the proxy or make a direct connection. The only websites that make a direct connection, without any proxy, are only school-affiliated websites. I'm guessing everything else goes through the proxy, as supported with this line that shows YouTube links and anything affiliated with YouTube go through a specific proxy. It actually shows the link within the code. In fact, all this code is just JavaScript... yeah I just discovered that now. Actually, wait, I've just discovered something really interesting. In the proxy config file that automatically loads when I start my Chromebook, there are some very specific Amazon Web Service URLS, and when I try to go to them, it says something along the lines of "This specified bucket does not exist." I think this might be a "raw" 404 page? I don't know. But something just popped up in my head. If these URLS are untaken, and the connection method within the proxy config file is direct, then does that mean if someone were to take that URL, and make something such as what I was talking about before, y'know the website with a bunch of unblocked stuff, would it technically be invulnerable to the proxy? Well, not really, but it sure wouldn't get blocked for quite some time. I would explain this, but I'm hungry, so I'm going to eat some food now. Good night nighty night Bye

Hello Hi, I have now decided to reimplement the OLD end of the world timer, which counts down to September 21st, 2028 at midnight, which is the real end of the world. Yeah!!!!! ANyway, I don't got any time left as I only have 2 minute until my next. SO so So by.

Yo, Hi. I have finally decided to update the character counts on my LTE Hub, and guess What! I have typed around 97,000 characters on my LTE!! According to my LTE Hub, I am currently Within 3rd place for the most characters!!!!! However, there's still a big gap. To get to 2nd place, I need to write around 100,000 more characters, and if it's taken me more than 2 years to write this amount of characters, then I'm going to be here for a while. Unless I somehow write around 50,000 characters within a Day, which will NOT HAPPEN!!!!!!!! Hmm, but, I guess if I just keep talking about random stuff, then maybe, I could do it within a year... I dunno, it's just a thought. Anyway, I may or may not write more later, cause I gotta do some stuff. Ok ok

Hi hi, still not dead, just too un-bored to write!! Wooooooo!! That's grapes! Only readers of the Pink-ish Pickle LTE get that reference...

What's up gamers, sorry for not updating for nearly 3 whole weeks of Pain and Torture and etc. I decided to Live My Life A Little... and unfortunately, it resulted in the temporary death of my LTE... But do not fret, my dear viewers... I have returned!!! I think? I dunno, but I decided to update this since almost 3 weeks ago. Yeah, I can't really think of anything else to say...! My LTE Skills have gotten a large amount of rust!!!!! I guess I'll need to get back into the Swing Of Things. but Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Yeah I can't. think Of Anything!!!!! My mind has gone numb and this food has turned sour! How OFFENSIVE... But don't you worry. I have no idea what I'm talking about, so that's for you to decide whether or not that's a bad thing. Yeah, I think it's because I have so little time left in my class, my brain automatically shuts off. ANyway, i think this is it for now, cuz I want to do other thing. :) Bye!!!!!!!!

Another week has passed... and I haven't done anything productive to Increase The Value of this website!!!!!!! Oh no thats not good! Guess I gotta Fix.! or ya something. Look man, I don't know what I'm saying these days... Just random nonsense!! I'm just really bored... of updating this website. Yeah I've been finding actual hobbies to participate in instead of Doing This. Whether that's a good or bad thing, up to you. I personally don't know... I'm tired, I want to go home, and sleep... but I cannot!!!! Because I have to do the school stuff, or else I will Not Succeed. And I don't want THAT... so Yea. anyway, Pink-ish pickle lte has been updated, check it out in the LTE Hub, yeah I'm out.

Another entry, another hour wasted... or something. Hello, I'm updating this because I don't have a reason!! Actually I do, and it's that testing is currently going on in our school, BUUT, our grade already tested in 2021, so we don't have to test again. So, they instead put us all in seperate rooms corresponding to a specific class we're in. Well, it's the same class, but different teachers. It's pretty much required by the state to have this class in order for us to get all of our credits... since we're an art school. Anyway, guess I'll talk about some other stuff instead of school. So, I'm in a classroom, with people I barely know, since all of my partners for the class we're in are testing, I'm just alone, in a corner, crying myself to sleep... JUST KIDDING!!! I'm not THAT sad and lonely! But still... (sad violin plays) Okay, enough of that. (sad violin abruptly stops) Currently someone's playing the piano in our classroom, as we're in our orchestra room, and then very faintly... you can hear someone watching meme compilations. Ah, the duality of good and evil... never gets old. Actually, IT DOES!!!! PEOPLE HAVE BEEN "Experimenting" WITH THIS IDEA FOR YEARS!!!!!! Like, c'mon! Get some originality! Actually, that's a trick request. Nothing is truly original... (sad violin plays for a split second) Anyway, my Chromebook is currently at 7%, so... yeah you thought I'd end the entry here. Well, YOU'RE WRONG!!!!! #TROLLED!!! I'm gonna keep writing until either our class ends OR my Chromebook dies. Actually, when that happens, I won't have any electronics to look at... because my phone is at 12% or something. Yeah, I throught I charged both of them last night, but apparently, THE CHARGERS JUST DIDN'T WORK FOR WHATEVER REASON!!!! They were literally plugged in and everything too, I don't see why they wouldn't work... anyway... I just thought of a good idea. Y'see, I like to Draw. And when I Draw... things go... Sour. Not really, I just like to draw weird things, because yes. So, that begs the question... Would YOU, yes YOU, my dear viewer and reader of this very Longest Text Ever... like to see a gallery page of all of my weird drawings? Well, I don't know if you said yes or no, BUT I'll assume you said yes, because I, yes ME, the creator of this LTE, like this idea Very Much! and you cannot STOP ME!!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA-oh god i think i just broke one of my ribs God Damn It. And someone's playing the Spiderman 2 pizza theme... while i'm dying... My life is going GREAT!!! now the guy that's playing the piano is playing the Spiderman 2 pizza theme as well... Anyway, I'll stop dying now. (regenerates broken rib bone) See? Good as new!! Hmmm... what to talk about... well my chromebook is at 4% now, after like 20 minutes of writing and thinking... and you wanna know the best part? I Didn't Bring My Chromebook Charger. Yea!!!!! Wooooo!!! Give it up to Me for that AWESOME DECISION OF NOT BRINGING MY CHROMEBOOK CHARGER!!!!! yea whateva. Now literally everyone is trying to play the piano, and it sounds absolutely horrible... It's literally just a Bunch of Piano keys being pressed at once. Is this what the call a "song"? I don't THINK SO!!! Oh great, now my chromebook is at 3% and has 15 minutes left of life... then I'll have to revert to using my notebook for writing my entries. Someone just played the first 4 notes of Megalovainia on the piano... What's next?!?!?!? Man, this is my longest entry since... March I think? Great, now they're playing that one FNAF 2 song on the piano... What really is next? I honestly cannot predict. Alright, I'm just gonna post this now as my Chromebooks at 1%. So, CYA!!!!

HiHi... i've just been changing some things to the website in the background, Such as organizing pages into folders and optimizing(?) this page. What I mean by optimizing(?) is that I've basically just put all of the javascripts into their own files and made this page reference them so they'd still work. I think that decreases the loading time by a little bit? I don't know. I roughly counted that on a school Chromebook, this new optimized page takes around 3.9 seconds to load, while the old one with the scripts directly implemented took around 4 seconds. So, I don't know if it's gonna effectively impact the load speed, but I sure Hope It Does!! Anyway, I have no idea what i'm talking about, so i'm just gonna Bye. Bye.

Jeez, it sure has been a while! 4 months... well, I guess that's what happens when you want to enjoy your summer vacation or something. Actually, didn't I say that I would only update this during the school year or something...? I have no idea, but back to about enjoying my summer... Really, the only thing I did all summer was just stay home and play them vimeo gamse. But, hey, that's pretty much what I do every day except for going to school and doing homework if I have any, that is if I can convince myself to do it that is... Anyway, HELLO!! I have returned... maybe. I will probably definitely absolutely only update this at a much slower pace than I was last year. Or, maybe not! We'll just have to see how the school year goes. But, honestly, I have been getting a little burnt out of updating this. So, as I've probably said before, if I just randomly stop updating this for around a half-year or so, I wouldn't count on this getting updated again. Anyway, small update. We recently got ThinkPad laptops instead of Chromebooks this year, with a mighty fine amount of RAM, 8 gigs to be specific. Now, that may sound too good to be true, and you're right! Because, in exchange for good RAM, the CPU got downgraded. Well, actually, I'm not sure about that, it might be the same, but it just seems slower as these laptops run Windows 10 rather than Chrome OS. Anyway, during the creation of this sentence I advanced about 3 hours into the future! If you don't know what that means, time passed. That's it. Get with the program!!! Or, rather, get with thy programmé... or something like that. I don't know!!! What I'm saying!!! Ahhh!!! ...Either way, I forgot what I was talking about 3 hours ago. So... uh... guess I'll talk about something else then? Oh, just got a glimpse in my head of what I should talk about. Yeah, that's right!! Alright, so, when we first got our new and "improved" laptops, I'd seen that they run Windows 10, right? So, the first thing I thought to myself was... "I wonder if I can install some games on here!", as any child would think, obviously. So, I decided to get a flash drive, put a game onto there, and then put that onto the computer! So, once the laptop recognized the flash drive in the USB port, I went to the directory where the game was stored and tried to open it. Unfortunately, it said something along the lines of ,"Your administrator has blocked access to this application", or something. I can't really remember... Either way, apparently the district was a lot smarter than I thought they were and implimented a whitelist to a specific few applications. Basically, just the stuff that the school required us to use. Yeah, that means no games... at least for EXE files. Yeah, you can still go onto Chrome and look for browser games there... as long as they're not blocked by the proxy. And!!! They even unblocked the Chrome dino game! But, I have a feeling that was an accident rather than being intentional. Uh... I don't really have much more to say, so I guess I'll end this here. Or maybe I'll start writing a new entry, I have no idea. Either way, I'm done. (for now) See you in next times.

Hey, whatsapp. I mean, what's up. I don't know! What to do. Yeah, I'm quite bored if you couldn't tell, which to be honest you probably couldn't... because this is text... Anyway, time to write some more because I have nothing else to do. Yeah!!! First things first, I'd just like to let you all know that the weird glitch that was on the Neocities text editor that was on my Chromebook? Yeah, that doesn't exist anymore on this new laptop! Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! But, it'll take a while to get used to, as my brain was trained to write with that glitch... or something like that. My brain isn't working right now... So... yeaah. I have no idea what to talk about. I'm just sitting here, in my chair, thinking about what to write about. Currently, I'm in my English class right now... actually wait. It's more of a geography class? Yeah, that's what it is. We currently don't have anything to work on, as the teacher is attempting to get everyone into this "textbook" thing on our laptops... It's confusing. I already got into it around 2 days ago, but it seems that other people are having problems. Whether it's because they're having tech problems or just don't know what to do, they're having problems for sure. Oh, wait! I do have something to work on. Buuuuut, I don't wanna work on it in class. I'll probably explain it in more detail in another entry since A. We have about 3 minutes before we actually have to pay attention to the teacher, and B. I'm lazy... Y'know, I've noticed something about the way I write... or rather type. Same thing, same thing. I think? I'm getting off track. ANYWAY, what I've noticed is that I write a lot of "..." in my casual writing. I think those three dots DO have a name, but I'm too lazy to look up the name right now... even though it'll take me 3 seconds. Actually, I've motivated myself enough to look it up, so that's what I'm going to do. Okay, well I tried looking it up and I guess Google doesn't recognize the three dots as an actual search phrase. I'll do it later... Either way, I have to go now. So... yes, that means I need to go. Good bye night day or yes?

Hello again! Today, I'm gonna write! ...isn't that what I always do though? Well, it's that or coding some more things into my LTE, and I don't feel like coding right now!!! Sorry, sorry. Just having arguments with myself again... jeez I really am a loser!!! Either way, this is MY LTE, so I can do whatever I want and talk about whatever I feel like. So, today, I'm talking about this little game my friends found called "EXP Simulator." But first! A message from our sponsor, the entirety of Britain. So, if you've seen recent news lately and haven't been living under a boulder, like a LOT of you do for some reason... you'd know that Queen Elizabeth recently passed away. Sad! I know... But, if you knew me in real life, and were my Friend... I would be a lot more insensitive than I am right now. What I mean by insensitive is that I'd make a joke about how America basically took a giant W for the Queen passing away, and that America doesn't need any royalty to worship. However, this isn't a group chat between my friends, it's a publically accessible website on the famous website creator/hoster Neocities.org. Therefore, if I were to make these jokes, I'd probably be tracked down by the British police and be sent to British jail... or worse. So, as I am currently being forced to write this segment due to said British police standing in my room and pointing a revolver at my head, I deeply apologize for making those insensitive jokes regarding the Queen's recent passing, and I will make sure to not speak ill of any deceased royalty for as long as I live. Thank you. ...are they gone? Okay, phew, they left. Sorry about that, I was being forced to write that if you couldn't read that one sentence about the British police pointing a revolver at my head, yadda yadda yadda, you get it. NOW. It's time to talk about... what was I going to talk about again? OH, right, EXP Simulator. So, my friends showed me this game less than a year ago, I'd say around April-May. This game is... addicting to say the least. I didn't find it that interesting when they first showed me it, but as time progressed, I got more hooked. I was quite far into the game before summer break, but due to us getting laptops instead of Chromebooks this year, none of my progress saved from before summer. So, I have to start all over. However, I'm getting my progress back at a steady rate, so I should be right where I left off in no time. It's also worth mentioning that I also managed to hack my save and basically get to the end of the game in around 1/10th of the time it would normally take me, possibly even more. If you want to play the game for yourself, here it is. Alright, I have to go now though, so see ya! Later...?

Just gonna make this short because, well, I don't know, I guess I don't feel like writing right now... ANYWAY, I added a new beta page which basically serves the purpose of seeing new content I'm trying to add while it's still in it's "beta" stage. Yeah, that's pretty much it. I may or may not explain more on this later, depends if I feel like it. Link at the top of the page right next to the Archives and TEOTW4 link! Insert goodbye here!

Well... it sure has been quite a while. Exactly an entire month has gone by... wow! Time sure does fly. Uhhh, I don't really have much to say, because I can't think of anything to talk about. Just wanted to let all of you know that both the Textra and Pink-ish Pickle LTE have been updated recently! So go check them out!! Uh, yeah. Well, might as well talk about what I'm working on at the moment. Currently, I'm trying to get this stupid cookies system working with the dark mode toggle. Been at it for nearly 3 days I think. I believe I'm getting close... but still quite a long way. What I'm planning to do with it is that so everytime you toggle dark mode, a Javascript will make a cookie with a value, either being 0 (for off) or 1 (for on), and everytime you come to this website, that Javascript will check the cookie's values and will change the color of the site accordingly. Currently, I only have the code set up to affect the index page, which if you don't know, is this page right here. But, I am planning to make it global to all pages on this site. Seems easy in theory to me, but it will probably take a while. Hell, I'm having trouble with something as little as setting a cookie for whether or not the body tag has the dark mode CSS class applied! It sounds easy, right!? Well, to me it does... but for some reason the script just doesn't want to edit the cookie. It'll create it, set the value to 0 (as it should, cause the toggle hasn't been toggled yet), but then it won't change it to 1 when the toggle is pressed. The editor and Google Chrome's console says there's no errors in the code, so I have no idea why it isn't working. I might have to consult the forum members over at StackOverflow... either way, my day's going fine, how's yours? Oh right, I can't hear you... Well, I guess I'll tell you about my day so far. So, I woke up, drank a cup of coffee, got ready for the day, mom is driving me to school and says she got a free extra coffee cause they messed up her order, says I can drink it, proceed to do exactly that, got to school and went to math class, started feeling sick in the stomach, went back home, and here I am. Yeah... y'know that doesn't really sound like a good day to me. Whatever... I'm tired of typing, er, coding, WHATEVER!!!! Anyway, like I said before, go check out Textra and Pink-ish Pickle LTE, and I'm gone now. Whoop!

Yo yo, what is The up. The sky!!! Hauhauhau. Uhh, yeah, I do not have a single idea on what I'm doing right now... my brain is not functioning! WEOW! Anyway, just wanted to say that I am temporarily removing the... uh... what was it called again? Hold on... ah whatever. It's the music player below the countdown. Yeah, that. I'm removing that because apparently Google Drive shows people who view the file on their platform who uploaded it, and their email address too. So... I'm not gonna host the music files on Drive anymore. BUT!!! I'll find a way to bring it back, even if there's no demand for it... I'll probably just host the file on a web server or something, probably using Firebase or Google Cloud or some other obscure platform. Speaking of Firebase... I'm considering migrating this site over to their platform. Key word: considering. There's still some things keeping me on Neocities. First of all, Firebase doesn't exactly have a online HTML editor... Also, Firebase does give your more control over your website, such as giving you more storage AND able to actually put video and audio files onto the website without paying! Well, not exactly. Firebase does charge you for monthly activity on your website, basically a quota. There is a free plan on their platform, but if you go over the quota, then your website will be temporarily shut down for the month. Yeah... I don't really want to deal with that. So, for the time being, I think I'll just stay on Neocities for now. Actually, the reason why I did want to move over to Firebase is that you're able to implement push notifications into your website, or as they say "web application", but I believe the process is complicated. The process is also complicated to implement push notifications into this Neocities website, but if I'm going to choose between the two, I think I'll stay on Neocities. Anyway, I think I'm done typing for now, Good bye... oh wait I forgot. I'm NOT LIKE A LOSER!!!! FOR GOING HOME!!!! BECAUSE I FELT SICK!!!! Get that through your head, Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er...

It's time to write some more!!! YAAAAAAY!!! Not really YAAAAAAY... im so edgy guys!1!11!!!1 Y'know, recently I've used the excuse of something like, "Hey Guys I Dont Know What To Say So Im Going To Say Something Random In Order To Compensate." ...I thought I'd explain more about that point, but I forgot what I was going to say. Anyway, first things first, new LTE found! And, apparently, they actually know that I exist... WEOW! That's a 2-for-1 deal if I do say so myself! It's named... 'The Potato LTE'. Y'know, that's kinda funny. Why? Well, my friend (Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er) is kind of obsessed with potatos. Their profile picture is a potato, their Discord and YouTube usernames have the word 'potato' in them... uh. Actually, that's all the examples I can think of. Maybe they're not so obsessed with potatos. Maybe I'm just ASSUMING!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, enough of that. Their LTE is in the hub, so go check it out! Apparently, they also used the form I put in the hub to submit their LTE and, uh... can I tell you guys a secret? It doesn't matter if you say yes or no, I'm still gonna tell you all. Uh... i havent checked the form in nearly a year. Possibly even a year and a half! Yeah, I know, you're all disappointed in me... and I'm sorry... So I'm gonna make a YouTuber apology video... to attempt to get you all to stop unsubscribing and to keep giving me money... by watching my videos... even though I don't have a YouTube channel... Well, actually, that's a lie. I DO actually have a YouTube channel, but I'm not gonna link it here! I'm not ready to show you all who I TRULY am... as the result is... well, I don't know. Just, no. I'm not gonna do it. I haven't even posted a video in a year or so... so even if I did link it here, it would show how incompetent I am at maintaining a YouTube channel. Maybe I'll post a new video soon... but you all won't get to SEE IT! Anyway, what was I talking about again? Oh, right! New LTE. So, I think they started sometime in early June, according to the earliest date I can find listed in the LTE and... they already have 110k characters. Yeah, I've been LTE-ing for 2 years at this point, and I just passed 110k characters last week or something. I need to step up my game if I wanna compete with this pro!! So, that means posting every single day, with Very Long Paragraphs, probably as long as paragraphs like the TEOTW story. Will I even be able to do that every day? Well, we'll just have to see! I'll probably have to come up with a list of things I want to talk about each day... actually that doesn't sound like a bad idea. Maybe I WILL do that! I dunno. Anyway, as you can probably see, I've changed some small general things about this page, such as the small description at the top of the page, to moving the beta page link to the bottom, with the LTE Hub link taking it's place. Yeah, that's pretty much all of the changes. In between this sentence and the previous one, I went to my next class as the previous one was, well, over. Sooooo, I kiiiiinda forgot what I was talking about. So, I'm gonna talk about something completely unrelated in order to increase the character count! I just realized that I put "November 4rd" as the update date. Yes. I think at this point you can tell I've run out of things to say. Uhh, I think after I finish this entry I might start attempting to put in the notification system. I'm still working on the cookies system though, it's... uh, complicated. Apparently, just using cookies wasn't very efficient on it's own, so NOW I'm using local storage in addtion to cookies. However, I can't seem to get it to work properly. Either the code I stole doesn't work, or I did something wrong... or maybe even both!!! I have no idea. It's complicated, that's all YOU need to know, because I'M the master, and YOU'RE the student. ya!!!!!!!!!!! Well, time to talk about something else completely unrelated. I'm currently in graphic design class right now, there's a sub today, and pretty much nobody's doing their work... including me. I'm hungry. I want food. NOW!!!!! But, I still have 25 minutes left in this class... god... damn... it... I'll probably post this once this class ends, because ya know I gotta get dem characters in, so that I can get clout. And then, my constant need for attention will finally be fufilled... and THEN... my life will serve no purpose, at which point I will combust and collapse onto myself. Then, my matter will be instantly destroyed and I will be no more! Or something... I dunno. I'm just talking about random stuff to increase the character count, now that I have some competition. Well, I've always had some competition, but the Pink-ish Pickle LTE doesn't get updated often, sooooooooooo ya. Either way, let's talk about my Good Friend Harry! that sounds like a tv show... Hey, that's not a bad idea! He DID always wanna make a movie after all. So, if you've read the most recent entry of the Pink-ish Pickle LTE, then you'd know that a good friend of mine, Harry, is starting an LTE! Yeah!!!!!! We finally have led an innocent person into the horrors that is the LTE community! He'll never be normal again! Anyway, by his request, I will not be linking his LTE in the hub yet. I will link it eventually, just when he wants me to. Also, on a completely unrelated note, we snorted cocaine in DnD Club last week!!! Well, not ACTUAL coke, but it might as well be. Basically, Pink-ish Pickle friend brought some powder that basically flavors water, I think it was strawberry flavored. Anyway, from what I recall, I think I made a joke about how it looks like coke, she said I should snort it, and I did exactly that. Not long after, she, Harry, and another friend of hers also snorted the powder. Yeah... i'm such a good role model... So, you may be wondering, "How did it feel?" Well, first when I snorted it, I didn't feel anything. Then, about 10 seconds later, my nostrils started to burn. Thankfully, I had some water with me, so that lessened the pain. I can't say the same for the others though... Actually, I'm pretty sure Harry snorted 2 lines of the powder, while we all did only 1. I have no idea how he's still alive... he didn't even have any water too! Or maybe he did, I can't recall. Well, I would write more, but there's only 2 minutes left of this class, and I said I would post this at the end of my class, so... yeah. Gonna do that. Good bye and day or uhhhh whatever.

[ INSERT GREETING HERE ] Uh oh!!! It seems the Greeting System isn't working properly. Well, that's fine, because it was all improv anyway. It is time... to write again. YEAH!!!! So, currently, I'm in my AP Human Geography class, and today we're supposed to "vote". What I mean by "vote" is that our teacher gave us a mock election ballot and we have to vote or something. I don't know. I'm tired. I just want to go home and sleep... Anyway, Pink-ish Pickle LTE updated again, but this time DON'T check it out in the hub. "Why?", you may ask. Well, the most recent entry that was added to the LTE is pure and unreasonable SLANDER towards ME!!! Calling me an "ABSOULUTE NERD." How RUDE!!!!!!!!! And... "YOU ARE A NERD AND A LOSER"? Let me remind you that you also maintain a LTE, so don't act like you're the Best Person In The World. Hell, I didn't even comment on the "tasting this sentence with your eyeballs" sentence because it's just so... Distasteful. So, instead of giving HER money by viewing HER website, don't. Stay on THIS website. Hell, even go onto any OTHER website in the hub if you wish to. Just, don't go on the Pink-ish Pickle LTE. Nobody that sour deserves any form of Cash. Now, let's stop being so negative, ya? Right. Now, if you've got good eyes, then you may have noticed that the Archives link has been removed at the top of the page. No, this wasn't a mistake. I just believe that having the link there is kinda... useless, considering it doesn't get updated anymore. So, I replaced it with a link to the beta page, which in it's own is kinda useless as well, but less useless. :) If you want to view the archives, then just click here. Keep in mind though, they Do Not get updated anymore, so any recent entries will not be there. Hmm... what to talk about now. Guess I'll talk about the Neocities logo I added below the countdown. Yeah, it's just some Good Ol' Neocities Appreciation. For, y'know, hosting my site. AND!!! You can click on it too, to go to Neocities, duh!!!!! Getteth with thy programmé, fiend! Ah... using "é" at the end of every word to sound sophisticated and smart. Always works! "With what?", you might ask. Well!!! ...i dunno. Something, probably. Anyway, I'm planning to add a script that changes the look of the Neocities logo whenever dark mode is enabled. Basically, just a black and white version of the regular logo, with black being the majority and white being the minority. Sounds confusing, I know, but it'll make sense when I actually implement it. I would do it right now, but for some reason whenever I put the image into Photopea, it compresses the Hell out of it, so I'll probably have to do it at home, on my computer, with a very legal and legitimate copy of Adobe Photoshop 2022. Yeah... I'm one of THOSE people. I also use a specific streaming website to watch movies and TV shows too, without paying! Actually, that's a good idea to talk about! Alright, so, you guys remember my Good Friend Harry, right? Y'know, the nerd that's also making a LTE and did coke with us in DnD club? Yeah, him. He suggested me a show to watch a month or two ago. Well, not really suggested, because the show is pretty much everything he talks about and makes references to... Anyway, it's called 'The Boys', and surprisingly, it's actually really good! I thought he was obsessed with it for no reason, or at the very least a stupid reason, but now I see why. However, it doesn't beat Breaking Bad. But, to be honest, nothing really beats Breaking Bad... that show is just pure cinema. I have still yet to watch the entirety of Better Call Saul though, but I'll get to it one day...! Probably when I'm really bored and got nothing to do, during the summer maybe? Anyway, I'm wondering when The Boys season 4 is coming out. Harry says probably in a year or two, which isn't that bad of a guess, considering the release dates of the other seasons. Also, just for the record, an entire day has passed in the making of this sentence so... I actually have some things to talk about now! I'm currently in that boring class where we have to make projects. If you've read the previous entries, then you'd know what I'm talking about. Anyway, we also have a showcase today! Oh, you guys probably don't know what that is... Well, in the elementary school I went to, the equivalent of a showcase was called an 'assembly' I believe. I don't know if I spelt that right... time to look it up on google... and I DID spell it correctly! I still doubt myself though. I doubt myself on a lot of things though, so it's not a very obscure feeling. ANYWAY, BACK ON TRACK. Basically, a showcase is when the entire school gathers together to either view things the students have made, because I go to an art school, or things like important announcements. Todays showcase is about a show the Theatre Kids(tm) have created. I can't remember what it's about though, something about a mattress... I'll get back to you when we actually go to the showcase. We also had a showcase yesterday, instead of it being about a show, it was about Veterans Day, because I live in the USA. YEA!!!!!! AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!! FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! VOTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT ONE BIRD THAT WE USE AS A MASCOT FOR OUR COUNTRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Alright, I'll stop spamming the exclamation points now... i still want this LTE to be considered a 'True LTE'. Hey, that reminds me, I still need to make that LTE Rules page that I promised to make over a year ago! Eh, I'll do it later... like all the homework ive been procrastinating over these past few months. Hahahaha... ha... yeah. I'm a very sad person... not REALLY! I have no idea what's happening to me right now. My brain is proceeding to fry itself at this current moment. WEOW! Alright, I'm going to the showcase now, I'll let you guys know how it went once I return. Bye Bye for Now!!!!! Alright, I got back from the showcase around 20 minutes ago and now I'm in my graphic design class. So, the showcase was about a show called 'Once Upon a Mattress', basically was just that one Princess and the Pea story but... different I guess? I don't really know. It's apparently almost 3 hours long and... uh. Yeah. That's pretty much it. Our school does a fall show every 3 years, and this is that fall show. Not much else to comment on I guess... Anyway, about graphic design. Photoshop is kind of confusing! It also doesn't help that the teacher doesn't want to help us. So... I'm kinda lost here. Y'know, if these computers had paint.net installed, then this class would be a lot easier, because I have around 2, maybe 3 years of experience with that program, and I could probably make all my project in that with ease. BUUUT, we're forced to use Photoshop. Soooo, I might just do my project at home today, if I remember that is. Now, on an unrelated note, I'm considering making a rewrite for this website. What I mean is instead this just being an LTE, I might make this site to showcase some other stuff I make. Maybe... I might have to change the site username just for it to make sense, plus, this site being named "longesttextever" might be kind of misleading. Some people might interpret this site as the Official One and Only LongestTextEver, which it isn't... buuuuuut... this name is kinda rare... I dunno, I may or may not change it. IF I do happen to change it, the new URL might be something along the lines of 'mckenzielte.neocities.org', or if it's available, 'mckenzie.neocities.org'. I do want the second URL for the rewrite, but it's probably taken. SO, if I do happen to go forward with the rewrite, the URL will probably be the former. Now, on a related note (for once), Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er is ALSO making a rewrite of her site. I don't think it's finished yet, or do I know what she's going to do with it, but it is in progress. So, ya. I would say to go check it out, but y'know, considering what she's said about me, I'm still quite betrayed... NOW, an LTE that you SHOULD go check out is The Potato LTE! It recently got updated, AAAAND they graciously provided the creation date of their LTE, so now the info's up to date and accurate. ALSO, they mentioned ME!!!!!!! Even more of a reason to go Check-It-Out! Also, if you're reading this Knockton, You Are Welcome : ). and also thanks for calling my LTE funny. That Is One Of My Goals, To Provide Humor. I Am An Artificial Intelligence. Not Actually Ha Ha. yeah idk lole. But still, go check it out For Real For Real. Jeez, this entry is getting Quite looong, and I have to go to lunch in about 10 minutes or so. Regarding that information, I may end this entry soon. So ya. Y'know, I have been considering that gallery idea I had a year ago, sometime near the summer break I had. I might put that idea into action if I choose to do the rewrite. However, I could still do it even if I don't do the rewrite. IDK, may or may not do it. What I am considering is changing the font family shown on the main page. Don't get me wrong, Verdana is a perfectly fine font. I just wanna freshen up the site a bit. I might use one of those clean sans-serif fonts, as I've always liked the look of those. Dunno which one I'll pick, however. Also, I should probably change the font of the beta page too. It's currently in Comic Sans... as I was trying to help Harry change the font of his LTE. Sooooo, even more reason to change the font of the main page. I think this is the longest entry I've typed... well it IS called a 'Longest Text Ever' for a reason, am i rite?!?!?!??!?!?!??!?! Hauhauhau, so Funny. I'm dying!!!! (die from hart atack) OUGH im dead!!!! Not really, just very bored, and waiting for this class to end. Well, at least it's not the boring project class, where I have to sit next to someone who clearly doesn't like me, either for my physical appearance or personality... I don't know. But, over the years I've kind of learned to block out what people think about me, but I'm still kind of self-concious... I've been like that for pretty much my entire life, if I recall correctly. However, it didn't really show in elementary school as those kids didn't really care what we looked like, they just wanted someone to play with. Ah... I miss those times. I miss my old friends too. Unfortunately, they all went to a different middle school. One that's... way worse than the one I'm at now. Last time I checked, it had a 2.5 star review on Google Maps, and most of them were from students or parents. Yeah... I wonder how they are now. Hopefully well. I've lost contact with all but one of them. I haven't talked with him in a while though... I'll have to see how he's doing. Anyway, I'm at lunch now, there's currently nobody at my table yet, but there will be soon!! I hope... Well, I think that's all I have for today, make sure go to check out The Potato LTE and DO NOT check out the Pink-ish Pickle LTE, and I am gone for the day. Or maybe not? Who knows... ok bye bye :)

I hath returne! Yeah!!!! What up. Sorry for not adding a new entry for Quite a While. I've just been focused on adding new features and, y'know, doing school stuffs. Screw you school stuffs!! So ya. I dunno. yes. WHAT DO I TALK ABOUT!!!!! 2?? Well, I guess I'll just get to the point. I'm not going to make this entry very long, or I'll try not to... I'll be saving that for another entry, that I started about a week ago and then lost the text for it. So, uhhhhhh. YEAH. Gonna have to re-do that. Good thing I didn't type very much on it... but still. Rest in piss, never miss... Ya. Anyway, I guess I'll talk about what I've been adding. So, I've added a character counter that isn't just a p tag on the page that I have to manually edit. No... it's an ACTUAL counter!!! I'll run you through the works. So, it gets two elements on this page, which are the character counter p tag at the top of the page and a div that has the entirety of the LTE inside it. Basically, it counts the length of all the text inside the div using innerText.length (im so glad that exists or else this would be quite hard for a javascript beginner like me) and outputs the result into that p tag AND it also adds some text after that outputted number, which is just "characters." HOWEVER!!!!! For some reason, everytime a p tag with at least 1 character inside it is created in the div, it adds 2 "ghost" characters to the counter. I have absolutely no idea WHY this happens, nor do I know how to directly fix it, BUT I came up with a rudimentary solution. Basically, I just subtract the number of current entries in the LTE, multiplied by 2, by the number of total characters. As of this entry, I'm subtracting 146 from the counter. I am looking into a way to automate this, but it will probably take a while to either find a code snippet to steal or code myself. So, that's pretty much what it does, and it's literally 3 lines of code. WEOW!! My class is going to end soon. GOOD!!!! It's that boring class again... and then next class I have Graphic Design. Still kind of boring, but way less boring. Definitely way less boring. OH!! Also, I've decided to put all of the scripts I've stealed/coded into one, so that it possibly loads faster, even though that doesn't really matter... BUT STILL!!! I guess it's nice to have all of the scripts in one place rather than in seperate files. Only 5 minutes left! Also-also, I've put the dark mode script onto some other pages as well, which only consist of the LTE Hub and the archives index page. Ya. If I make any more pages (that'll be open to the public), then I'll make sure to add dark mode to them as well. Unless if I don't want to. Lol. Uhh, yea I can't think o anything else ta say. So, I'm ending this RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!! by.

Hi. Hello. Hey. Yes. Time for more writing!!!! Yea. Yo. Yo. Uhuh. Yea, I dunno what I'm doing rn xd xd. But yeah, I'm writing some more, so that I can catch up with thy Potato Long Text Ever (link in hub). Speaking of the potato LTE... it recently got updated! It technically got updated today, which added a hit counter, but the most recent entry was added yesterday. Regardless, go check it out. ALSO, If You Are Reading This [ Knockton ], then In response to your thoughts about the Recently Added Character Counter(tm), no I DIDN'T copy you... im not a COPY-er!!!! Never have, never will. ...okay so MAYBE I Was a little inspired, BUT!!!! It's not exaaactly copied, so I think Fair Use comes into play here. ya. Pink-ish Pickle LTE hasn't been updated in about a week... if you are reading this Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er... UPDATE YA LTE!!!!! I can't believe I have to say this to ya, considering YOU were the one telling everyone to update their LTEs a year ago... but HERE WE ARE! Hmm. It appears I only have 5 minutes left in my current class (graphic design btw). 4 minutes now... and now I am currently at lunch, eating... well, my lunch. Obviously!!!! yeah, I just chugged an entire can of 'AriZona Southern Style Real Brewed Sweet Tea'. "To be or not to be, that is the question." Those are the exact words my Good Friend Harry has spoked to I. Yeah, really basic. Just like his whole Personality!!!!! Oh!!!!!!! Roasted!!!!!!!!! I think this is the point that you can tell I've already run out of things to talk about. Yes, only this far in to this entry... and I'm already running short on topics!!! Hold on, let me think... Status report on the potato LTE, a new entry was added just 20 minutes ago as of writing this! So, even more reason to go check it. Out. I forgot to put the out in the first sentence. Actually, I didn't forget. I DID IT ON PURPOSE!! Becaause, both Knockton and Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er both said that I need FLAVOR!!!! in my LTE!!!!! or wait, is it flavour? Eh, same thing, forgetaboutit. or is it forget-about-it? OR IS IT FORGET ABOUT IT????? is it Potayto or Potahto???? Tomayto Tomahto??????? This is TOO CONFUSING!!!!!!!!!! Maybe this is why I'm failing english class... fjfjfjfjfjfjfjfjfjfjf. I don't know what a 'fjfjfjfjfjfjfjfjfjfjf' is, but it sure is somethin'! Okay... i've talked about LTEs updating, random nonsense, what else? Huh, my lunch is close to ending. Well, that went by fast, am i rite?!??!?!?! Wait, I already did the 'am i rite' joke... that means I can't use it anymore! Or else it's not funny! Oh noEEOOEOE!!!! This is So Sad Guys, Can We Get 1 likes. on the fortnite chungus video. Please. I need my upvotes. My karma.... i dont even have a reddit account!!!! But, I have something worse... a discord account!!!! AHHH!!!!!!!!! Wait. It's not October anymore. That means being scared is illegal! Ou Nou! This is So Sad Guys... wait i already did that joke. Insert I can't use it anymore! Phrase Here. Yeah, I'm not typing all o that again, even though it would increase my character count. Alright, in the process of making this sentence, I have moved from the cafeteria INTO another class. Ya. Uhhh, I have no idea what this class is though. Actually, I do have an idea. I know exactly what it is. But I'M NOT TELLING YOU!!!! Because... it might compromise what school I go to. And therefore, where I live. Because I live inside the school. Hell, I AM THE SCHOOL!!!!!! Just kidding, april foooooools!!!! ...oh, it's not April? Well, screw you! It's april... for ME. and ME only. Y'know, I just thought of something. How long would the paper be if you printed this entire webpage onto a single piece of paper? I might try that sometime... if only I had a printer. My parents... well, parent as of recent, was thinking of getting a printer, but that was a few years ago, so she's probably changed her mind. Anyway, enough of that sad talk. Uhhh, I guess I'll talk about some things I'm thinking of adding to the site, since two specific people have stated I need flavor in my LTE. First things first, the gallery idea. I've talked about this for a while, but I haven't really tried an effort to actually get it implemented. I have a few ideas in my mind, but I've written none of them down. I think I might do a scrapbook style for the webpage, with photos and/or screenshots of things I've either illustrated OR actual photos. If I will put actual photos into the gallery, then I'll make sure to censor any faces in the photos, as they probably don't want their faces on a random website. Yes, this includes MY face. I'm still not ready to show the world... the person I am....... oh no im becoming edgy again. I need to take my Totally Real Medication that Isn't just Pain Killers!!!! oh wait these aren't pain killers they're Weed Pills. I wonder if those exist... pills with the effect of weed. Sounds interesting, I bet my mom will like em!!!! That sentence doesn't imply anything about my mother. I have to say this. Help. hmm still thinking of things to write about... hmmm i need to increase my character count... hmmm i think this is against the rules of making an lte... hmmm that reminds me i still need to make that lte rules page... hmm i think ill do it later... and by later i mean NEVER!!!!! It's NEVER COMING OUT!!!!!!! I baited all of you. ALL OF YOU!!! hahaha. But, my friends. that was merely a JEST!!! A 'joke', if you will. Someone in my class said, "Where the heck is Wyoming?" Uhhhh, i think it's right by Idaho but ummmmmm im not sure. I must consult, the map, the myth, the legend... GOOGLE MAPS!! uhhh hold on its loading. . . . . . .. . . .. . . .. .. . .. . .. .. .. ........ oh screw this i'm just gonna copy and paste from wikipedia. "Wyoming is a state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. It is bordered by Montana to the north and northwest, South Dakota and Nebraska to the east, Idaho to the west, Utah to the southwest, and Colorado to the south." Thanks Wikipedia, here's my source. Yeah! I was right! It is right by Idaho! Actually, it's left by Idaho. xd. Alright, my class is nearing an end. Only 2 more minutes!! and then I will be home free. Actually, that's a lie!!!!! I won't be home free. I still have 2 more classes!!! Oh, 1 minute left now. AAaaaand, there we go. Well, I'm currently in my 3rd class of the day, and I have an assignment to do, so I'll pause right here to uhhh hopefully do that. Hello! I'm now in my 4th class of the day. I did only 1 part of my work in my last class, so uh, good enough? Yeah, I should probably work some more on it. Buuuuut, i don't want tooooooo. STATUS UPDATE 2! Pink-ish Pickle LTE got updated, and I think I'm finally over the betrayal now, so DO check it out this time instead of not checking it out this time. I just read it and... oh. uhhhhhh yeah. Um. Well. That was... interesting. Yeah. Hm. WELLL i dont care so LOL XDDXDXDDDDXDXD Um. I gotta get more characters in... RIGHT, back to what I was saying. I'm in study hall rn, supposed to be studying but i'm not, instead i'm writing to This Thing. Ya!!!!! OH WAIT, I Know What To Write About Now. So, this afternoon, I checked my total views on my LTE aaaaaand... I've reached 10,000 views!! YEAH!!!!!!!!!! I'M BETTER THAN ALL OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11 ive finally accomplished something notable in my life... Oh wait, here's the screenshot I took, so that you can't prove I'm lying. Uhhh, sorry, I took a 20 minute break from writing. I've just been looking on the MDN Web Docs... why? Well, I honestly don't know, I guess I got distracted. I gotta say, I do like this a lot more than W3Schools. AND, the fact that the website has dark mode is a lot more... what's the word, relaxing? on my eyes. I'm tired... not very tired, but still tired... I could probably take a nap right now, but, y'know, I'm still in school. Speaking of school, I only have 15 minutes left until I go to DND club. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yeasadadadasadqwfwweffasdf. What? Sorry, I couldn't hear you. ehuehuheuhuhfhefuhefhnef! Oh no, I think those weed pills are finally getting to me...1..1...ONE?!?!? WHAT DOES one HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?!??!?! uuuuuugh. I think you can tell I've run out of things... to... wait. I already said this. So that means I can't say it again. 'Why?', you may ask. WEEEELLL, back in my day... uh. damn, I cam't remember. also, "cam't". ha. that's funny. real funny. Yes. Well, there's only 3 minutes left of the day, and then I'll head to club. Uhh, I may or may not work on this in DND club so uhhhhh yeah. So turns out I did not work on this in DND club and today is now the next day! Thursday! And then Friday! And then No School! And then School Again! It's a never-ending cycle. I haven't been able to work on this a whole lot today, guess I've just been getting distracted. Actually, would it be... yeah I forgot what I was going to say AS nearly 4 days have passed. Yeah!!! It's Monday now, and we only have 2 days of school this week, which is good! However, I have a lot of homework I need to catch up on, so... not very good for me I guess. Hhhhhhhhhhh, i need to get more Character. I require Character. Character are my Substance. Yed. Not? Yed? Not? What are you talking about? Your name is $, and you live at 4444 Street, New Drive. I find it weird that British people say Z and Math as 'zed' and 'maths'. They aren't normal!!!!! Just to clarify, that's a joke, because apparently people don't like jokes on the internet anymore, So I have to Clarify. Or at the very leaste, that genre of humor. But hey, humor is subjective, so if they don't like those jokes, I can't really blame them. Or, I could, but that would be... unconventional. ough I should really be doing my schoolwork, but I don't want to. But, I really should, or else I'll die. FYI, I'm barely maintaining a 2.0 GPA, which I need in order to keep my... uh how do I spell it again? Hold on, google... uh nvm, I don't feel like looking it up rn. It's that one thing that can pay for your college fees or whatnot. Yeah! That! That one specific thing! That I don't know how to spell! I don't know how I'm even in high school! Seriously... I was born on a very weird date and my parents decided to put me into school basically a year before I was supposed to go in. So... I'm struggling a lot more than my classmates due to my brain not being developed... or whatever. I don't know! I think I'm just making up excuses for being dumb... But that's all I know how to do! I wish I could just... be good at everything. Yeah!!! And you can accomplish just that with the Brain Transplant!! Only for $47,000 per month, you can own and use a new brain that's guarenteed to be smarter, better, and more efficient than your current one! Genetically engineered in our own labs, we can assure you that our brains are the best ones in the world! No need for expensive American Healthcare, or cheap European Healthcare... with our brains! Shop smart. At PetSmart! or is it petsmart? Petsmart? I don't know, they don't pay me enough for this. -_-_-_-_- Wow! It's a chain of -_- faces! That's cool. I've been working on my schoolwork every few lines I've written here, mostly because the teacher is right next to me, talking to one of my classmates. So, I gotta be careful, or else my secret will be revealed... and I'll be lectured!!! For not doing my work!!! When I should be!!! Can you imagine that?!?! Being lectured... not doing something you're supposed to be doing. Insane! This is so... BAD. I hate it!!! Ya im writing, ya. I might post this entry today, or I might wait until tomorrow. Or I might not post it at all. WhO KnOwS!?!?!?!? We have a dance class at our school. I hate it so much. But not the teacher, the teacher is fine, nice too. But the CLASS Itself... nah. And you wanna know the worst part? No? well, SCREW YOU!!! I'm telling you anyway. It's a REQUIRED CLASS we have to take in order to GRADUATE!!!! WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHY DID THEY DO THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHY CAN'T THEY JUST HAVE NORMAL PE REQUIRED!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S SO MUCH MORE FUN THAN DANCE!!!!!!!!!! BECAUSE THERE'S MOST LIKELY PEOPLE IN THAT CLASS THAT LIKE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND IT'S A CLASS THAT I ACTUALLY ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!! I have a feeling I've talked about this before, but whatever. I need more Character anyway. And by Character, i mean Character(s). Character(s(s)). I accidentally pressed Enter... Why I am telling you this? YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME!!!!!! Actually, you probably do, cause I need Character, ya. Ya bruv. I've realized that the -_- chain kinda looks like MIDI. Kinda. Not exactly, but just 'kinda'. I discovered the very useful program named 'yt-dlp' last night. It's quite useful, very useful I'll say. I would've used the regular youtube-dl, but it seems to be broken. Not broken in the traditional sense, but just outdated, as downloads seem really slow, due to un-patched throttling YT implemented I assume. yt-dlp fixes that however, and is frequently updated. Am I shilling yt-dlp now? It sounds like I am... that's how useful it is. Now I can listen to all of the cool musics locally, instead of using Chrome and having it steal all of my RAM!!! Also, just useful to have the cool musics stored offline, in times that I don't have access to internet. However, they're only on my computer, so I should probably transfer them over to my phone too. I wonder if yt-dlp works on Soundcloud... I'll have to check, so I don't have to keep using soundclouddownloader.com with billions of pop-up ads. Oh, right, I have uBlock Origin, so that isn't much of a problem... Well, except for my school computer. The only adblock we have is Adblock Plus. Yeah, not my first choice... but I guess it gets the job done. Actually, I think it was the first adblock I chose when I got my first computer. Ah, how the times have changed. At least I don't use an adblock that requires a subscription to work, unlike one of my friends (It's not pink-ish pickle LTE-er or good friend harry fyi). It's funny, all of these useful programs I've found were mostly on this piracy subreddit. No, don't worry, I don't use Reddit on a daily basis... I still have SOME self respect. I'm ALSO not gonna link the subreddit, cause y'know, I don't want to risk this website being taken down. But, if you know how to use Google, you can probably find it. I honestly don't feel like doing any work at all... kind of including this. I feel... unmotivated I guess? I dunno. It's a specific feeling. A something feeling. A feeling of something specific. And that feeling is specifically something. Classmates are talking about STDs or something. I don't really pay much attention, it's rude to listen uninvited. I keep checking my email and Discord to see if there's some sort of interaction going on involving me, but alas, no dice. I'm in Graphic Design. Got a project due supposedly tomorrow, when I don't have a class, and a project that's past due. I was planning to work on it at home, with paint.net, but as usual I got distracted. I accidentally spilled a half-full cup of coffee on my laptop. I let it sit for around 2 days, seems to be working fine except for the fact that some of the keys are hard to press down. And the keyboard is sticky, but I already cleaned that up. I backed all of my important data up on my 4 TB hard drive I got for my birthday a few months ago. Honestly, I might just move all of my games and shit to that hard drive, just in case. But, it's also good practice to put downloaded games on an external hard drive anyway. Why? I don't know, I just read it online somewhere. Or is it 'red'? No, that sounds dumb. Read, but pronouced differently, with a different purpose. I need to do schoolwork, but I can't stop writing. Can't stop, won't stop. Unless I have to. In such situation, I am to terminate all online access immediately. Or something. This sounds edgy... I've been typing with less ellipses since a few minutes ago. Found out what the three dots are called, which is the strange looking word I used in the last sentence, just plural. Non-plural version is 'ellipsis', if you wanted to know. Now you can use that in your essay or whatever! Got 13 minutes left of this class, then I get to see my friends at lunch. Supposedly, I know at least 1 of them is here, don't know about the other 3. I think I took a typing class in elementary school. I don't remember much of it, nor do I utlilize what I learned from that class. That being said, I think I'm a relatively fast typer, counting some mistakes of course. I think I'm good at typing words I'm looking at from an external source without looking at my computer class. I type like that a lot in my AP Human Geo class. I type quite loud too. I wonder if the people next to me get annoyed when I do that. There's this one person at my table that keeps giving me weird looks. Not because I'm typing loudly, I don't think. Because of another reason. I have an idea, but I would be making baseless claims at that point, and I don't want to spread rumors. Not like anyone in my school reads this anyway, except for my friends of course. Someone is watching Cocomelon on the school computer... I had to look up if someone's had an apostrophe, which it does, but it didn't make sense for the sentence, so I just used 'someone is' instead. Checked my phone again, only a YouTube notification. Apparently Markiplier is livestreaming Getting Over It again. Class is ending it 3 minutes, so I'll continue this at lunch probably. Hey, I'm back, turns out Good Friend Harry wasn't here, he's in Arizona rn. Everyone else was here tho so that's good. Also, I didn't continue this at lunch, as I'm in my 3rd class of the day now. Anyway, in this class we're supposed to do 'peer reviews' for our essays we're writing. However, Good Friend Harry isn't here and the other person at my table is... sleeping I think. I know I really should get some work done for this, but I don't want to be rude and wake them up for something they probably don't want to do either. Plus, they're literally the only other person at our table and we need to get 3 peers to review our essay sooooo... Also, I forgot to write this too but Potato LTE got updated again. Well, more so a few days ago, but still got updated. Go check it out, link in LTE hub. I think Pink-ish Pickle LTE got updated too, so go check that out as well, link is... well you probably know where it is by now so I'm not going to bother saying it again. ...okay fine, link in LTE hub. There, I said it!!! Now, stop bothering me... Honestly, it's kind of easier to just type normally instead with all of the wacky exclamation points and ellipses. Maybe I should try this more often. Well, the person in front of me just closed their computer and sighed, putting their head down. I would ask what's wrong, but I have a feeling they don't like me very much, as is tradition, so I won't ask. Maybe I should stop listing their every move onto this page... lol. Well, we only have around 20 minutes left in this class, I actually managed to do some classwork before I started writing to this again. I didn't finish it though, but I'm planning to do that in study hall, which is my class after this. Then, I'll go home, probably do some very overdue homework, and then go to school tomorrow. We do have DND club tomorrow, but I'm not going to go, as I just want to go home and relax for the entire break. However, I still have to do that one project for that project class. Y'know, the boring class. I wonder if I do something to prevent all of my procrastination. Well, only 15 minutes left now. I think the person in front of me is staring... right into my soul. Not sure, too busy typing, lol. Our teacher is talking to some students. I hope she doesn't come over here and ask how the "peer review" is going. Honestly, I don't think I'll do it. I mean, it's only 4 points, and it's not like it's a big assignment either. Something I do need to finish though is my essay outline. However, I think that'll be pretty easy. I mean, it basically walks you through on what to do and how to do it. If I were just a little more motivated, then I'd probably have it done by now. But no, I'm sitting here, typing to this console. Not that I don't like writing to this, it's a fun hobby, just listing all of my thoughts onto this small website. However, it just seems like whenever I decide to make an entry on this, it seems like I could be doing something much more productive, which a lot of the time is the case as I usually update this during the school day. Jeez, this entry is getting long. I think it's the longest I've ever wrote. I'm breaking records, ma! Well, probably not a national record, or what was it called... nvm, don't feel like looking it up. Anyway, the Potato LTE is getting scarily close to beating the Flaming Chicken LTE in character count, and soon Hermnerp's LTE. Honestly, I've slowly started caring less about being the top LTE in character count. I mean, yeah, it'll be quite Cool to be the definitive 'Longest Text Ever', but it's not really my main goal anymore. What is my main goal then? Well, I don't really know. I guess it's to just... uh... write? Yeah, I don't know, maybe I worded that wrong or something. I'm going to check the character count for this entry after I finish writing this sentence, which'll be right now. That was close, the teacher almost talked to us about our peer reviews... Luckily she didn't, I wasn't ready to lie... uh, maybe I shouldn't be talking about this on this public website. Anyway, I checked the character count, and at the time of finishing that sentence, it was at about 21,000 characters, minus some for i and b tags in the text. Anyway, I'll probably post this at the end of the day, when this class ends. Well, I'm going to research (aka steal code) on how to replace an image when a specific class is applied to the page. Yes, this is about the Neocities logo and dark mode. Alright, I believe I've found the correct code for it, now I just have to actually make the dark mode version of the logo, which I can't do at the moment. I'll probably bookmark the pages or something. Also, just an update, I'm now in my last class of the day. Well, I was when I typed the 'post this at the end of the day' sentence, but just in case. Plus, I need more Character. I love Character. It's my favorite Flavor. Oh, no, I'm starting to become less serious and more like my old self... OH NO!!!!!!!!!!!!! ahem, sorry about that. Hopefully that doesn't happen again, but no guarentees. However, to improve on our consumer's safety, we strongly recommend to stay behind the striped line at all times. Or else. HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHhAH!!!!!!! Again, sorry. Well, now I can't think of anything else to talk about... Even though we have an early release today, the day still feels long as hell. However, that's probably because we only have a few classes today instead of all of them as we usually do. Alright, so apparently I got relaly distracted and I didn't write anything for nearly 20 minutes. Now, there's only 9 minutes left of the day until we go home. Well, I don't think there's anything else I wanna say, or really anything I can say to fit within that time, so I'm ending this entry here. Hmm, maybe I'll try to go for 30,000 characters next time... we'll just have to see. ;)

hahaha foolish Pink Pickle LTE er. U thout you cold fool ME?!??!?!?!?!?!?! Wrong... Wrong!!! WrONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ahem Ya, I'll prob work on a new entry next week caus I don't feel like doing it over break Plus Homework So Lol. kk by by

uhi I'm currently in the process in archiving all of the inactive LTEs in the hub, because I said in the description of the WhileTrue LTE that I should probably archive them all. And, with the recent death of Kenneth Iman's LTE, I think now would be a pretty good time if any else of them decided to flatline as well. Speaking of the WhileTrue LTE... I actually just checked the page a few minutes ago to archive it (the one with the conlang or whatever it's called) and apparently, the original got restored! Yeah, I'd thought I would need to go onto archive.org to get it back, but I guess they finally decided to put it back up on the original page. Still, I archived it just in case, but it's nice that WhileTrue restored it. Anyway, the LTEs I have archived are BusterDdog, Hermnerp, Flaming Chicken, WhileTrue, Iseycupcake, and Textra's. The remaining are either dead links or blocked by my schools proxy, so I'll have to do them at home, along with the mountain of homework I've been procrastinating, haha. Also, potato LTE got updated a few times over the break + weekend and updated today, so like I always say, go check it out. Also, they seem to be Stealing my archives idea. How dare you!!!!! Just kidding... it's fine you can totally steal my original idea i'm not angry or anything :)))))))! Well, that's all I'm going to write today, cause I only got about 5 minutes left in my class, and then I gotta do an entire project that's due tomorrow at home. Also, I just figured out that I shouldn't use the center tag as that was deprecated in HTML 4, so now I gotta do some wacky CSS stuff to update that. Also also, I'll be working on my weekly LongAssEntry(tm), so I probably won't update until the end of the week or something. Or not. Who knows... ok Bye!

Well, this is the weekly LongAssEntry(tm) that I'm writing now. I'm saying this because I have no idea how to start this. LOL!!!!!!!!!!! Hmm, what to talk about... ah I know. So, I've archived all of the inactive sites on the LTE hub onto this here website. Yeah, I was originally going to just archive them on archive.org and put the links onto the hub, but that would be quite Boring, plus Internet Archive is blocked on my school proxy, which means it's probably blocked on other proxies as well. So, that would be kinda counter-productive. Instead of taking the boring route, I decided to copy the HTML code from each individual website and put it onto here. So, y'know, it would probably be more permanent here rather than it being on archive.org. What do I mean by this? Uhhh, yeah I honestly don't know. I'm just writing whatever comes to my head without any second thought. Also, I'm tired. Very tired. And I want to go home. Very home. So I need to go to... my shed... house. That was a reference! Please subscribe and rate 5 stars if the joke was funny :)... what am I saying? Yeah, this is what happens when you get only 3 hours of sleep. Good thing my mom makes me coffee every morning! Yeah, I don't make the coffee, she does. Ha. Haha. I should probably learn how to make it myself though, just in case. I mean, I know how to cook a frozen pizza in the oven! Is that good enough? I don't know, me, is that good enough? Oh no, now I'm talking to myself again. Now I gotta go to the doctor... and have them replace my brain... again... Sigh. Sigh sigh. Sigh sigh Sigh? Sigh. I dunno what im saying Lol Xd. Again, what happens when you get 3 hours of sleep. Hashtag relatable!!!! IS it relatable or relateable? Are you able to relate? Are you relate to able? I don't relate to able, because I'm DisAbled. ahem. I'm getting off track. Uhh, I'll probably put the link to all of the archived LTEs in the hub somewhere, so check it after this entry is posted, which will be in like a week. Anyway, now onto something slightly related but not fully, I also made a raw text version of my LTE, which you can probably find at the bottom of the page. I think I'll put the character counter at the bottom too, just to make the top less cluttered. Speaking of character count... apparently the character count on the raw text version is 76 characters more than this formatted version. Why? Well, I honestly have no idea. I think it might have to do with the line breaks that happen when a p tag is finished, or something. You can tell I don't really know because I literally pulled that answer right out my Ass. Not literally, that'd be gross. Plus, how would I even do that? Would I talk with my... actually, y'know what, I'm not going to finish that thought. Now, onto current events regarding real life me. I'm in my AP Human Geography class, and I was supposed to be taking notes the entire time, but I decided that archiving the remaining LTEs was more important. At least I can still access the slideshow to take the notes later... My legs hurt from all this sitting. But, to be honest, I'd rather have this than having my feet hurt when I walk long distances. Actually, there's a small story regarding that. But, I think I'll tell it later because my stomach is starting to hurt from little to no food intake in recent hours. So, I shall dine on my carefully crafted lunch. In about 12 minutes. Yeah, it's not lunch yet, but i wish it was. Alright, I've eaten lunch now and I am fine I guess? I don't know? I'm just gonna end every sentence with a question mark? Yeah? Okay, this is epic? But also getting kinda old? I'm going to stop now? Just one more sentence though? Yeah, enough of that. Hold on, I'm thinking... of what to talk about. I seem to always have this same problem with my more longer entries... I'm asking my Good Friend Harry for a quote to say for this entry, hold on. Alright, nevermind, he can't think of a quote. Gosh dang it!!!!! I can't thimk of anuthing to say.! Yeah, I think I'll add onto this tomorrow, as the rest of my classes don't require me to use my laptop. So, uh, see you guys tomrow! Alright, I'm back, and it's now the Next Day. Wow! Time passed! So amazing! Anyway, I'm in that one boring project class, which isn't that boring anymore since we're doing presentations on our projects... and my project isn't done at all. Hell, it's barely started. Good thing I present next Friday though, so I still have some time before I show the people my Very Good Project Thumbs Up :). A person just asked me to swap places with our presentation dates, said that their project broke (i think it was some sort of pottery) and was presenting on Monday, however they can't put their project in that... uh... giant oven thing people put their clay pottery in, until Monday. I told them that I wasn't done with my project at all cause, well, I'm not. I do feel bad for them though, hope they swap with someone. Maybe if I wasn't such a SLACKER then maybe I'd be able to do that person the favor, but unfortunately, that's just not the world we live in... Y'know, I just thought of a really good idea for a project, and now I'm suddenly motivated to Do said project. However, it's too late to change my topic for this current project now, but maybe the next one I could do it. However, I'm pretty sure it's a group project, so, unless it's with people I know, it probably won't happen... Either way, I'll explain what I have in mind. So, there's this web series on YouTube, created in 2017 or so and ended I think a year later? I can't remember. Anyway, it's titled "Petscop". It's about this supposedly unfinished PS1 game made in 1997 by the company Garalina. However, this game actually doesn't exist!!! And it has the power to raise the dead!!! It's kind of scary!!! Basically, the real MEAT of the series isn't in the 'colorful' section of the game, but rather the more-so Dull and Scary part, which happens when the main character Paul inputs this code he found on a note attached to the game and exits Even Care, the first and only level of the 'game'. I'm not going to explain the whole story, not that I even know the full story. It's complicated. Very complicated. And I like it. I don't know why, really. It's just... interesting I guess. Here's the channel if you want to watch it. And, if you don't really understand the story, that's fine, I didn't understand nearly anything at all about it when I first found out about it in 2017. So, if you want a little more... what's the word, understanding? Yeah, I guess that'll do. Let me put it into a coherant sentence. So, if you want a little more understanding about the series, I'd recommend you watch this video. It's actually by one of my favorite content creators! His long-form commentary videos are very fun to watch, especially with the editing. If you like that form of content, or like the person who made the video, then I'd recommend you watch his other long-form videos as well. Some good ones are the Cry of Fear video, the one about The Platform, also the one about Fall Guys, and that 7 hour long Utopia video. Another one I'd also suggest is the Far Cry 3 video as well, but the ones mentioned previously are my favorites. I got really off track. I'll stop shilling Pyrocynical now. But still, he makes good content, so go Check It! ANYWAY, back to my project idea regarding Petscop. I'm thinking of making a fake website for it. Let me explain. So, y'know how most popular video games usually have a website regarding things about the game and it's contents, right? Well, I'm planning to do the same for Petscop. Of course, I won't advertise it as being official, because that wouldn't be Cool, but I'll try to make it seem like something that would be official. Actually, something like that was actually planned for Petscop, 'Petscop Discovery Pages', but the creator of the series decided against it because he thought it would ruin the mystery aspect of the series... or something like that. And, honestly, I agree with him. I mean, if something like FNAF released all the lore in just the first 2 or so games, then I don't think there would be any demand for any new games from that point, which is why I think FNAF has survived this long. I believe the same thing goes for Petscop too, so does the creator it seems. Anyway, I'll try to keep that aspect in if I decide to go forward with the project, only mentioning little to possibly none of the Spooky Sections of the series, only about the 'game' portion. I think I could possibly do it too, I'd make the website 90's styled, maybe a little more modern. Also, I'm also thinking of making a fake trailer for the game too. I think editing should be easy, so goes with recording. In fact, I'm not going to use any footage from the game at all if I make the trailer. So, you might wonder, "how ya gonna get footage HUH?" Well, there's actually a playable of recreation of Petscop being developed, titled "Giftscop". Made in Unity, of course. I think I'll use the recording feature in Giftscop, then view and record the recordings in the 'demo' mode. If you have literally no idea what any of this means, go watch the series!!!!!!!!! I'm also thinking of composing an extention to the title screen track of Petscop for the trailer, I'd just need to look for a flp if one exists. And then, with my totally legit and legal copy of FL Studio, I'll do the thing probably. Then I'm also thinking of using Blender to animate this cool section for the end of the video, basically the gift box from the Petscop logo zooming out of the camera, with the letters falling down and doing this tween, like how it does in the title screen. Then, I'll put some traditional game trailer stuff below the logo, and then... Just for a second or two... at the end of the trailer... I'll show the guardian entering the Newmaker Plane!!! Yeah, that's all I have in mind for the trailer. Just imagining it in my head makes me motivated. Uh, hold on, gonna post the entry onto the beta page right now, just to save it. Hey people reading this, the entry isn't finished yet!!! So, uh, wait for the full thing I guess!!! ahem. Now. I'll need to do some research for some 90's-era game websites, if I want to make this Accurate. But not now, because I need to procrastinate. People in my class are talking about... things. Movies, actors. Something along those lines... I just checked the character difference between this page and the main... it's over 10K characters already. WHAT!!!!! It doesn't even seem like I've typed 10K characters... And it's only been 2 days, and I barely had time to write yesterday! I might actually reach that 30K characters goal I said at the end of the previous LongAssEntry(tm) if I keep this up. Quick! I need things to write about! DND! Yeah, DND! Yesterday, we did some DND in DND club, as, well, it's DND club, what do you expect? Anyway Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er recorded a nearly 18 minute video on some Funny Things we did. She edited the video down to 6 minutes and uploaded it to her YouTube channel, which was literally created yesterday, for the sole purpose of uploading that video. I'm not gonna link it here, as I don't want to be doxxed just yet, nor do I think Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er or anyone else in our club wants that either. Also, you can't look it up on YouTube either. It's UNLISTED!!!!! so HA!! Anyway, some highlights of what we did... Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er usually eats the rest of her lunch at club, as do I most of the time. I requested some of the Flavor Powder from her, she gave. I didn't snort it this time though, just put it in my water bottle, like a normal person. Good job past me. Anyway, Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er also had these... other flavor things. I think they're called... "MiO"? I don't know. I've seen them before in the various stores around me, but I haven't tried any. And I didn't try any yesterday either. Good Friend Harry did though. Raw. What do I mean by "raw"? Well, instead of putting it into his water bottle, like a normal person... actually I don't think he even has a water bottle. Getting off track again. So, instead of... yeah i'm not repeating that you can read the last sentence, he instead squirted it into his mouth. Multiple times. So did some other people in our group as well. Also multiple times. I just had lunch with all of my (best) friends at a single table, I am finally complete. YAY!!!!!!! Now, where was I? Oh, right. Uh, actually, I think that's all I wanted to say about DND. Now, here's something I, or rather my friend, found out. Apparently, we all have been spelling smoky the Wrong Way our Entire Lives!!! Let me give some context. So, there we were, eating our lunch, chatting, the usual. I was eating a small bag of Lays Chips, barbeque flavor to be exact. Decided to look on the bag for no apparent reason, and I saw something that caught me kinda off-guard. Above the chip picture on the back of the bag, the word "smoky" was present on the bag. Now, I had thought for my whole life that the correct spelling of smoky was smokey. Now, that isn't entirely false, but I was just using that form the wrong way. Did some more research about a minute ago and 'smokey' is typically used to nouns and/or first names, hence why Smokey the Bear has that form of smoky. However, the other spelling, smoky, is used for what I had been using the other version for my whole life, as an adjective. When one of my friends pointed out the more-so correct spelling, I had felt lied to my entire life. Still do... I just found out something while browsing the CSS reference on MDN web docs. There's a CSS property named "color-scheme". Basically, it's typically used for systems that toggle between light and dark mode. Currently trying it out on the beta page CSS, gonna update it once I'm done writing this sentence. I have returned, and now I'm in my last class of the day. I didn't type much during my last class, as I had some work to do, and I still do. But, as you all probably know, I'm a procrastinator, so I gotta do what I do best. I'm going to experiment with some things, mostly regarding CSS, because I don't feel like typing much right now, so I may continue typing tomorrow. Oh also, before I possibly go, Potato LTE got updated today about an hour ago from the time I'm writing this, so as I always say, go check it out and READ!!!! I'm back, not gonna write much as it's that day that I don't use my laptop in any of my future classes today. Currently at lunch, eating things, talking with people, ya know. As you can probably see, I've improved (imo) the visual look of the website. I was looking at CSS things on MDN web docs and I discovered some things that look quite cool, that being a browser-handled gradient and a backdrop filter. I've added both, including dark mode varients, because I think they look quite nice. However, if people don't like the new look of the website, don't worry!!! I'm planning to add a little settings page you can access using a small gear icon in the top right corner of the backdrop. In there, I'll include a dropdown that can let people toggle between the old and new styles of the page, which I'll probably title 'Classic' and 'Modern'. I'm also planning to make a dropdown for the dark mode style. What I mean by this is how it's set currently, the page has this gradient from white to black, which slowly gets darker as you scroll down the page. Now, I'll also add another style for dark mode, which'll be more similar to the old version of dark mode, which basically just toggles between a basic black or white, while also maintaining the similar modern style the site currently has. Then, I'll also add another style, which is basically just the old dark mode, no need to really explain that. Or maybe there is a need? I don't know, don't care that much. Tired, as usual... And I can't think of anything else to write, either. Currently researching that settings page thing I was talking about, so I guess this'll be all for today. May or may not write tomorrow, probably the former, idk Lol! That sure was quite a while! Sorry for taking a small break from updating, I needed to work on some school work as I was quite behind, and I still am!!! So, that small break is still ongoing, just to let you know. Uhh, yeah I can't think of anything else to write, probably just gonna stop writing here and actually post this onto the main page on Friday. Pink-ish Pickle LTE and Potato LTE updated too, so go check those out. That's all I have to say I guess... lol i lied still no update XD!!!!! But FR, I'll try to update and post this on THIS FRIDAY... if i dont then im dead........ in real life......................... Also im testing something right now so Ha. Alright, last update of the week, then I die! I'll try to make this long. Actually, about 3 classes have passed in the making of this sentence. So, ya!!!!! Alright. Time to speak. Talk. Whatever. It's called. Yuppers! So, this week's been... interesting to say the least. Some things have changed with DND recently. First, Good Friend Harry abandoned all of us and left us with the... other DM (Dungeon Master). I do have to say, this other DM's oneshots are more entertaining than Harry's, but it just doesn't feel the same without him. Now, he has a new group, with new people. He left us... My teacher for my class is playing this sad music while we 'work', so that's why I'm sounding so Sad, if you could even tell. and then we just heard the Google Snake sounds come from her computer and lost getting 1 apple lmao. So, not very sad anymore. Uhhh... oh! Also, if you remember that boring class I talk about sometimes where we do projects or whatever, WEEEEELL! Usually at the end of the semester, we have to present our finished projects. Yeah, sooooo... you know how I said that I'm a procrastinator in one of the recent entries? You can probably see where this is going. Anyway, I had to present today and I told myself last night that I would edit my project (which is a video) during the night before going to bed. However, I actually just fell asleep instead of doing that. So, when I woke up at 7:30 or so, the first thing that came to my mind was, "Did I edit that video last night?" And the answer that I found out was a resounding No. My heart skipped almost 2 beats. So, I literally had to speedrun edit the video in the morning before I had to go to school at 9. 1 and a half hours should be plenty of time, right? Well, not for me!!! I was starting to run late, as I was nearly finished with the video and ready to export it, just had to add another text filter on a video. But... my editor decided to crash as soon as I attempted to add that text filter, because I chose the 'rich' version instead of the 'simple' version! I knew my computer could handle it, but apparently the editor couldn't. So, I thought I was done for, quickly searching online, 'how to recover unsaved shotcut project'. Then, I found something. Something about going into appdata and looking in autosaves, and thank GOD Shotcut autosaves projects. I loaded the autosave, and everything was there that I did before the crash, so that was a relief. Anyway, I added that last text filter, exported it, then went to school. There, I didn't make my presentation slideshow yet, because we were supposed to do that and I was supposed to do that last night before I fell asleep, so I took around 20-30 minutes to do that. Then, I presented it. Presentation went fine, I think. Got some feedback, nobody questioning or saying anything... foul. Overall, I think it went good! Which is good for me, because I get nervous talking in front of a lot of people, especially people I don't know all too well. Then, just did some more school stuff, had a party with 2 of my best friends (Pink-ish Pickle Person and Good Friend Harry) that was really fun. We even did something called 'White Elephant', too! Well, we do it every year, so it's really no surprise. But still, it was really fun now that I'm good friends with both of them now (even though I was good friends with Pink-ish Pickle Person before but Who Care). The thing I got were some... socks. Yeah, not what I really wanted, so I just kept saying, "it would be really inconvenient if someone stole these socks from me", and finally, someone stole them from me!!!!! (it was Pink-ish Pickle Person, who in return wanted me to cry, in which I delivered) So, I got another choice of a gift, and this time I got... a scarf! Now, it wasn't as cool as some other things that were there, but I was fine with it honestly. In fact, I'm wearing it right now! Inside! Where it's warm! My neck is sweating so much! Not really, it's not that warm in here. Anyway, the gifts I put into circulation were some christmas suspenders and a big box of different flavors of hot chocolate. My mom picked out the gifts, by the way, cause by the time we found out I had to bring something for White Elephant, it was literally 8 PM the night before. And my mom was at work still, so she decided to go get something at the store when she was off work. She asked me if I wanted to bring something specific, and I said I didn't care. Good Friend Harry didn't bring a gift, cause he forgot to, like a LOOSER!!!! Anyway, I gave him a bag of Original Ruffles to put into circulation which was originally intended for the pizza party we were having. Unfortunately, our teacher didn't put it in the circle when it was time, it would've been really funny (to us at least). Anyway, then Good Friend Harry and I went to our third class of the day, which we had together. He was talking to some sort of AI on this website he found a few days ago. Here's the link if you wanna check it out, it's interesting but gets old quick IMO. It can be funny at times tho. During DND club on Wednesday, literally half of the club wasn't there, so we did literally whatever. We tried to do a oneshot with all of the remaining club members, which was a pretty big group. Unfortunately, we couldn't get past the first five minutes of doing that, so we just did whatever as I said before. Harry and I talked to some of the bots on the website, I think we mostly talked to this one about Among Us. Yeah, that's right, Among Us is funny again. Dear god, what have I become...!? Anyway, it yielded some funny results to what we said to it. Then, 3 people from our group left to "look at the moon". Pink-ish Pickle Person did this before, most notably in the second installment of DND Funny Moments, a series Pink-ish Pickle Person started soon after we started doing DND stuffs. There's only two episodes at the moment, as I said before, we don't have Harry as a DM anymore, so I have no idea if it's still continuing or not. However, there's some bonus content too. I'd link it, but I dunno if Pink-ish Pickle Person wants me to, plus it has our faces and potentially our real names in it, soooooooooooooooooo... ya probably not gonna link it anyway. Well, I think that's all for IRL stuff. Maybe there's something I'm forgetting, but idk. I mean, this is the last week, or rather the last school day, before we have winter break for 2 weeks, so that's nice I guess. That's really all I have to say on that. I may or may not post this at the end of my school day, which is in just under an hour from now. Oh, also, we (Good Friend Harry and I) got some Skittles for cleaning up tables in our class. Oh, I gotta go, we're watching a showcase rn. Hi, all the new sentences before this one were written before winter break, just to let you know. Also, I forgot to update!!! AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!! I'll do it sometime today, for sure tho. Absolutely not gonna back down on my word! Yup! Anyway, I won't write much today (1/3/2023), in fact this sentence will probably be the last one I write for today! Actually, that's not true! Cause that sentence exists! And that one! And that other one too! ...yeah I'll stop with that. But yeah, gonna probably stop here, will push this beta page to main probably tomorrow, but don't count on it. However, I shall try..! Alright, bye... hi I broke the entire script for dark mode AND site style. Lol! uhhh ill try to fix it, that's why I haven't pushed this to main page yet, because there was an annoying bug that caused switching site styles to not function properly when using dark mode. But now, i've just completely broke it!!! Also, it's probably unoptimized as all hell, cause it's just a bunch of if else statements as I DON'T KNOW JAVASCRIPT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh.. i'll probably just revert the script to an older version before i rewrote most of the dark mode and site style code and Broke it. so ya. I might just push this to main with the bug I mentioned earlier, as it's not really that much of a deal. It's better than the entire thing being broken, at least. Anyway, that's all I'll write today I guess...

Finally, after all these years... i'm starting a new entry. Sure has been a while since that happened, huh? Yeah, I just kept forgetting to actually update that the previous entry basically never ended. Uhh... wow I'm gonna say something I always say...! I don't know what to write. There, I said it! I said the thing!!! Well, the reason why I'm even writing this entry in the first place is basically just to kill time until class is over, and then I get to go to lunch with all my friends! Yesterday, one of my friends brought this game called 'Exploding Kittens'. I've heard of it before, but I haven't actually played it, since I pretty much had no friends (in school anyway) before early 2022 I believe. Well, Pink-ish Pickle person was my only friend before that, so that statement isn't exactly true... But still. Most people I interacted with were merely classmates and we didn't really talk anywhere outside of class, and even when we did talk in class it was primarily for classwork rather than for conversating. Anyway, I'm getting off topic talking about myself. Shut up, me! Anyway, back to the game. From what I remember, we all get 7 cards plus one more. That one card is a 'defuse' card. I'll explain what that does in a little bit. But, to progress in the game, you need to either use one of your existing cards against one of the players OR draw a card, which ends your turn. All cards require you to have 2 of them in your deck. There's two basic types of cards however. I don't know the official names, so I'll just call them whatever I think they're called. One type is the 'cat card'. When you have two of those, you need to play both of them, which allows you to take 1 random card from a player of your choosing. The other type is the 'action card'. When you have two of those, you can play one of them and execute whatever action the card states. Now, you may be wondering where the 'defuse' card comes into all of this. Well, there's actually a third card type, which only consists of one unique card, but a lot exist in the drawing deck. Those cards are called 'exploding kittens', as the name of the game suggests. If you draw one of those, you need to show it immediately to all other players in the game, and play a defuse card. If you don't have one, then you're DEAD!!!! you DIE!!!!!!!!! Okay, not really, but kinda really. If you draw one of those and you don't have a defuse card, you're eliminated. However, if you do play a defuse card, you live, but at the cost of using up your defuse card. So, you'll either need to draw one from the drawing deck or steal one from another player. Actually, I'm not sure if the defuse cards are present in the drawing deck. So, you might just need to steal one in that case. It's pretty fun, that is if there's more than 2 people playing in my opinion. I think he's brought the game today actually, so we might play it again at lunch. Or maybe not, I don't know. I've noticed that I've been recently inserting a lot of un-needed commas in my sentences. In fact, in the two previous sentences before the "I've noticed" sentence, I've removed two un-needed commas. Wow! Good job me! But also shut up me! I don't know. Uhh, I think either yesterday or last week I suggested Pink-ish Pickle Person to update her LTE, but I can't remember what she said. I have a... questionable memory. It seems that things I'm supposed to remember I tend to forget more often, and just literal random shit I think throughout the day I tend to remember. It's strange. I guess that's what I get for not getting my needed vitamins when I was younger. Screw you, younger me! You've ruined my life, and my grades! Oh, there's only 2 minutes left of class. Well, I probably won't write more today, as my classes don't require my chromebook, so I guess that's all for today. Bye-o. Bingo? No, Bye-o!

Alright, I've decided I won't really do those long entries anymore (or at least for a while), as they're a pain in the ass to read in my opinion and usually make me forget to actually update the main page. So, I guess I'll transition to doing these short-to-medium length entries like I used to do. Well, I was working on trying to fix the bug with the site style and dark mode options, but I've since then decided to attempt to rewrite all of that part of the script using local storage instead. From what I've read, local storage is much more adequate for this type of thing than cookies are, as data in local storage is managed and read primarily by the browser and not the server. Plus, I think they're more efficient or something. Anyway, yeah, I'm trying to do that, but I keep getting stupid little errors so I'm taking a break from that cause my brain hurts too much! Yay!! Plus, it's really warm in this class I'm in, so that's also contributing to my headache! Hunger, also! And possibly dehydration, too! I'm in graphic design class right now, and I did absolutely nothing productive other than try to work on my website. I have around 14 minutes left, and then I can go to lunch and hopefully get rid of this headache. Oh wait, there's another thing contribution to my headache, lack of sleep!! Well, it would probably be more like lack of proper sleep. I think I slept 5 hours last night, as I went to bed around 3 AM like I usually do. Why do I do this exactly? I dunno. Well, I do know, but I also don't, if that makes sense? I now only have 5 minutes left in class now. I spent those past 9 minutes trying to think of things to say... and I still don't know what to say. I guess I'm just bored. These people in front of me are watching MrBeast Gaming on the school computer. Come to think of it, I don't think I've watched any of MrBeast's content ever since he still did that 'Worst Intros' series. Well, I don't really have anything else to say, plus there's only 2 minutes left of this period, so uh, bye!.?..??!?

You know, I've just thought of something I might just do with this website. So, do you remember a while back when I was talking about making a site with a new name and migrating this LTE over to there? No? Well, that's fine. I don't quite remember much what I said back then either. But that doesn't matter because I'm going to explain what my idea is. So, I've just been sitting here, looking at the profile page of my website, specifically at the view count. Currently, it's at 12,722 views. Quite a lot! Well, at least I think it is... Anyway, looking back on that idea I had a while ago that I mentioned in the first sentence of this entry, my brain just kinda expanded on that idea. Just... out of the blue I guess. I mean, I know what caused that to happen, but I kinda don't at the same time. It's complicated. Now, this idea was similar to what I first thought of a while ago, but kinda different too. So, what this idea planned was to migrate this LTE to another website... domain I mean. I don't know, it's just a different site, alright? I don't think I'll title it something like 'mckenzielte' or 'mckenzie' though. I'm mostly sure I made a Neocities account a while back that I was using for a different purpose but since abandoned. Why? Well, I don't know, I can't really remember all of the details that long ago. Geez, I just logged into the account on my phone, and just looking at the site and previous posts... it's making me CRINGE!!! I was a loser back then... which was around 2 years ago. I think I was trying to do some sort of ARG or something. Sure did seem like it. However, it does have the domain name I want, which is good. It's actually the name of this old YouTube channel I used to post on. It was called something different in earlier years, but the current name is the same as the site. Anyway, I'm getting off track. So, according to this idea, I'll move my LTE onto there, BUUUT!!! You may be wondering, "what will you do with this site then? will you just delete it?" Well, no, my dear reader! I won't just delete it! In fact, I'll repurpose this site to host the LTE hub instead. It makes sense in my opinion. The domain name is literally "longesttextever", so one could imagine this could be THE site to read LTEs. AAND it has a lot of views already, so people who are either new to the LTE community or people who have never read an LTE could see this website with a lot of views and say to themselves, "Hmm, maybe this is the site where I can find LTEs or something!" You see what I mean!? And I could stop potentially posing as THE longest text ever using this domain, as that seems kinda scummy imo. A concern that may arise however is that some people may be confused on where my LTE went, but honestly, if they possess the ability to read the English language then I think they'll be fine. Also, another plus is that I could actually do other things with the website (the one I may move this LTE to), such as that gallery idea I had, or hell maybe even other things too! But, although there are these many pluses to moving my LTE to a new domain and converting this one into just the LTE hub, I'm still contemplating. I don't really know why though. Just... something tells me that I shouldn't be so sure about this choice. I don't know, it's a confusing feeling. Oh! Before I go, the Potato LTE was updated a day ago as of writing this, so go check it out in the LTE hub! Also, it's nice to know that they (Knockton) also remember MrBeast's Worst Intros series. I had no idea that he privated the videos though. I guess that shows how out of date I am on my MrBeast knowledge. Alright, I'd say it's about time for me to stop writing, only 5 minutes left in this class. Goodwell and farebye! wait, I don't think that's how it goes...

Alright, what's up!!! I've taken the decision to move my LTE to this website and... uh. Yeah? I guess that's it. I can't really think of anything else to say, as I've been kind of stressed recently. I mean, I could talk about why, but I don't really feel like doing that riiiight nooowwwww... I don't know, maybe I'll talk about it in another entry. I'm really cold right now too, it was I think around 35 degrees F around an hour ago, I think it's still that as of writing this. Maybe that's why I don't wanna write much. Also could be due to this stomach ache I have. Ow! Uh, yeah, I guess that's it then. I'll update the longesttextever site shortly and do things. So, if you're coming from that site when it's updated, HI!!!!!!!!!! ok bye

I'll make this quite short, but I've officially moved my LTE to this site now, and I'm now using this site to.. uh.. lte stuff I guess. Yeah. HI GUYS ITS UR MOM HERE I LIKE TO DO THINGS YEAH I HAD LESBIAN SEX WITH GOD. oh geez i think i just got hijacked. By the Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er. OH MY GOLLY GOSH GEE!!!! Well, I did say I'll make this quite short, and I'm keeping that promise even though its not actually classified as a promise, but rather a statement I made. I don't know, shut up! Go die! In a fire! Yeah. kk bye bye lol lol

Well, I guess this is the first actual entry on this new site I guess? I don't know? Hm, well I guess I'll get to the point. I'm probably deprecating the beta page, as Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er stated in her LTE, "I HATE this, because this is just an extra button press to go to the beta page for no reasonnn." At the time, I didn't agree, but that opinion has changed over time, and time has passed. Wow! I love when time passes! I also love passing time! Actually, does time pass or do we pass time? Hmm, one of the many questions still left unanswered... Maybe I'll ask it on Quora or something. Nevermind, it's already been asked. Just googled it now, actually. Unfortunately, I can't see the full answer, because our school blocked us from accessing Quora. They also patched the Google Translate method too. DAMN IT!!!! Oh, I got offtrack... *ahem* Now, back to what I was talking about originally. As Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er stated before, there really is no point to have a beta page. I mean, if I want to test new features, then I'll just make a new page in a special secret folder I made in the directory. No, I'm not going to tell you what it is... because if I did, you guys would be spoiled on what features I'm working on next! And that ruins the ultimate surprise! [ FUN FACT: There Is No "ultimate surprise!". ] Wow, thanks Fact Bot... But also screw you Fact Bot... So, the whole point of this small rant-but-maybe-not-rant is that the beta page is essentially useless at this current point in time. So, it's going Bye Bye! Bye Bye beta page! Well, now I got That sorted out, I guess I'll talk about some things I'm working (or planning to work) on. Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er suggested for me to add a "Back to Top" button, so I'm gonna add that. It'll probably be a sticky element that starts to show at the very beginning of the LTE, and sticks to the top of your page when you scroll down. I'll probably fix whatever's happening with the character counter as well, and automatically add commas to stylize the number a bit more. I don't really know how to do that, but I'll find a way. Probably. Okay, maybe not. BUT!!! I shall try... Uhh, I'm at lunch now, and None of my friends are here. I'm so lonely!!!!! Wa!!!!! Hopefully next week changes that though... he haw he haw... Yeah, I don't really know what to say or whatever. I'm quite Hungry... so I'm probably gonna eat some Food. I guess that's it for this entry, lol!

Well, Pink-ish Pickle LTE-er finally updated her LTE. Wowza!!!! That's quite Epic. If I say so Myself. ummm yeah i actually dont have anything to say rn cuz its the weekend. And I don't update on the weekend. Except for right now, but that's an exception. Y'know! Um yeah bye ?!??!?!

Okay, maybe I'll do an actual entry or something. I don't know... It's 2:35 AM right now and i'm tired as Frick!!! im in a call with pink-ish pickler right now and have been for the past 6 hours. God dam!!! Uhh, so, some things happened. First, and foremost, I updated my main page. It's quite nice, even though it's still incomplete. But, that's to be expected. I can't really get everything done in a single day. Or... maybe I can!? Well, probably not in this state. tired... yeah I'm getting easily distracted by small little things. But, I guess that's what happens when you stay up until 2:30!!! Uh, sorry about that, I took a quick break reading various things from the Ice Chewing forum. It's quite... interesting. to say the least. Yeah. Well, I think I'm gonna go now, cause I'm tired as HELL!!! so uh yeah, i guess ill talk to you guys later. Bye!!!!!!!

Ey Yo, im back! Back in Black. Men in Black? Uhhhh yeah i think. I don't know, I was trying to make a reference but FAILED. MISERABLY!!!! so sad... Ahem. Well. I'm making a new entry cuz im bored n all, the usual. A few things happened today. First, we're currently in a winter storm at the moment. But, we still had to go to school. BOOOOOOOO! Apparently where my school is resided, there was literally no snow at the time our classes started, so the admins thought, "Well, I guess we can pester our students to come today!" Even though where I live there was snow EVERYWHERE! But, I do live in a different school district than the school I go to. Okay, now there's snow Everywhere. Even Here. That's Ebic. We might not have school tomorrow after all. Good, honestly! I'm supposed to take a math exam tomorrow, so I'd love if that was pushed back... I'd love it... so much... :) :) ANyway, Pink-ish Pickler updated her main page quite a lot recently. Hell, it looks better than mine... god DAMN YOU!!! I'll get around to adding some more things. Maybe. Possibly. Don't count on it. Wait, why are you counting. I SAID NOT TO COUNT ON IT!!!!!! ...sorry about that. I'm just. Weird. Lately. I don't really know how to explain it, y'know Y'know? Uknow (I think). Also, supposed to have DND club today but it got Cancelled. Cause of the snow. There's so much snow. Maybe I'll include a picture... But it'll probably be after I add this entry as I'm in study hall at the moment. That means I'm supposed to be doing something productive. So I'm acting like I'm doing something productive. Wow This Is So Productive ! man i gotta piss. Don't really know why I typed that into here, guess I thought you guys should know that. ...Maybe it'll be better if you guys just pretended that sentence never existed... even though I literally have the power to remove that sentence from existance. But, it's too late now. I can't go back... (well actually I can but im just too lazy) Well, um. What to talk about now... Oh! Potato LTE was updated, so go check that out. Ummmm, Pink-ish Pickle LTE was updated too, so go check that as well. Maybe I should focus on adding some features I said I would add. I mean, Pink-ish Pickler added the "Back to Top" button before I did, so I ummmmmmm. Uh... Jeez, I can't really focus on typing. It's strange. I don't know if I'm stressed or excited. Sorry, I was just... doing things. Like attempting to fix my main.js and reading the Pink-ish Pickle LTE. Again, go read the Pink-ish Pickle LTE!!! Or else. I think that's all I have in my brain currently. I probably did have some other things, but I have long since forgot. Bye...

Whaddup guys, back again. Tell your friend(s)? Guess who's back, guess who's back, etc. You get the idea. Well, I guess I'm back to the grind of... sigh. School. it SUCKS!!!! But, you also kinda need it to, y'know, become a contribution member of society and whatnot. But, it's just so HARD!!! For me, at least. I don't know, it's strange. Nearly all the people around me seem to be handling school just fine, but here I am just... struggling. I don't really know specifically why, I have a few ideas though. I mean, I do get quite distracted easily. First example of this, right now actually. I should be taking notes right now, but I'm not. Instead, I'm writing to this LTE. I guess I'm kinda doing this to myself, which is GOOD! Why? Well, that means I'm basically affecting nobody around me, so it's not a big issue! Well, it's an issue for me, but who really cares about that? As long as I'm not affecting anyone else, then it's fine I guess. I never really worked well in groups anyway. In fact, I've been committed to that mindset since elementary school! ...Yeah I know that sounds made up, and I don't really blame you for thinking that way. But, sometime in either 4th or 5th grade, I realized that I worked somewhat better alone. Not really in efficiency or anything actually productive, but rather for... emotions I guess. By myself, I don't really work all too efficient, but at least I won't have anyone to disappoint! Well, besides my parents. Parent, as of recently. But hey, I'm fine with that. Another issue I have is that I get demotivated easily, which applies to school work too. Even small assignments seem like just... too much at times. Due to those feelings, I never really finish any of those small assignments, even though most of the time they're easy. However, still knowing that an assignment is easy still doesn't change those feelings. I typically have to either be in a very good mood or forced to do those assignments. And hell, that's even less so for more difficult and big assignments. Now, it's time for something completely different. In the last entry, I did say that I might include a picture of how much snow there was. Here's that image. Yeah, you Better be grateful I actually decided to take a picture. I almost forgot... Well, now I'm in good ol' study hall, in which I will promptly do absolutely Nothing Productive! When I should Be! Yay! iuiihiihiiihiiihihhhihhihiuiiui Yeah. I'm working on a Minecraft Resource Pack for 1.16.5. It's called "Soyfilled". Cause the pack. Is filled. With Soy. SO much soy. That you can't even believe it, bro. uhhh yeah, the progress I've done on it so far is replace some of the music with their SiIvaGunner equivalents and change some text in the lang json. Oh, I've also completely removed any mention of Birch in the game. The blocks still exist, they're just not birch anymore. Why? Birch is objectively the worst type of wood, just below acacia. So, in MY resource pack, there's no more birch. No texture, no reference of it in the lang json, nothing. I've done you all a huge favor. In fact, in my server that I host and play on, I was getting some wood to make into sticks for the stick trade. The type of wood I chose to solely commit eradicating and extincting from my server to be made into sticks was birch. Of course, I didn't get rid of ALL the birch in the forests that surround us, but maybe I'll spend some time doing that tonight... I still have a lot to work to do on the resource pack, since I intend to replace nearly everything from the vanilla game into my own in it. Oh, I should also mention it isn't really a serious resource pack, if that makes sense. I'm adding a Fuck-Ton of memes into it. and NONE OF YOU CAN STOP ME!!!!!!! One thing I was considering adding to the resource pack was to make the Villagers and Pillagers represent people of a certain... event that occurred in the past. However, I know that would be offensive to most, so I probably won't do it. Or, at the very least, make an alternate version of the pack with those changes replaced with something else. At first, I thought it was a funny idea, but now I've realized I'm just being a dick by adding that. I don't think I'd risk my reputation just for one dark joke. It does make sense, though. That's why I'm kinda on the fence on adding it or not. Maybe I will just make two packs... I have a few other ideas on what I'd replace the mobs with, but they're just concepts. Oh, I'm also making sand be Sans. Because haha. Soul Sand is gonna be Soul Sans as well. Hahaha. actually comedy gold. I'm also gonna replace End Stone with Cobblestone, and vice versa because again, Haha. It'll kinda be a Repaint of Minecraft. Speaking of, I think Games Repainted may have done a repaint of Minecraft once. If so, then I'll probably steal some of their ideas cuz screw originality. Be as copied as you want to be! I might also make a datapack too, but that's a little more complicated so maybe not. Depends on how motivated I'll stay to hopefully finish this project. I happen to start a lot of projects, but never finish them. This LTE is one of those exceptions I guess. Well, until I abandon this once I become unmotivated once more. Anyway, this class only has 5 minutes left and my next period doesn't require me to use my laptop. Or at least, I don't think? I dunno, we'll just have to see. Anyway, have the goodest of byes! bYE

Hey hey fellers! What Is The Up. The Sky Is The Up. HA. HAHA. HAHAHA. Yes. Did you like my joke, guys? I did. Thanks, me! No problem, me! Wow, I love complimenting myself. Its just those small things that make your mood better, y'know? Ahem... well, I'm sure you guys have noticed (or not but that's fine) that the Birthday of This LTE (and pink-ish pickle) is... tomorrow? Oh, shit. Uhhh, just one small problem with that. I haven't prepared anything. For that birthday. And I wanna do something. For that birthday. hmmm, well I've had a few ideas in my head, but nothing put to action. I'm not gonna share any of em with you, of course. At least until the day of reckoning approaches (which is tomorrow). Actually, a small amount of time (about an hour) has passed since that last sentence and I've decided on what I'm going to be doing tomorrow. I have no idea if it'll actually work or not, but time will tell. Anyway, yeah that's it lol Bye.

alright Hi guys. So as it turns out, my little idea kinda flopped. Lol. So, I didn't do anything for the birthday of My LTE. Maybe next year... I'll think of something better! My idea was to make EOTW 5 and have all my friends join in and add random shit to the document, but NOBODY PARTICIPATED!!!!!!! I'm So Mad, But Not Really, Cause It Was Kinda A Bad Idea. I don't know, maybe I will make EOTW 5. But, if I do, its gonna be the Best out of the rest and the Last. I think the EOTW tradition has gone for long enough, and literally nobody cares about it anymore. Well, besides yours truly. Anyway, decided to write cause I got nothing else to do. Actually that's a lie as I have plenty of things to do. But nahhhhhhh, those can wait. lole. Okay I just took a test in one o' my classes and I think I at least got half on it. I didn't study any of the nights before because, of course, procrastination. But, I did study during Geometry with Pink-ish Pickler today. Well, Pink-ish Pickler didn't literally study with me but I was in the same class as her at the time. If that makes sense... Two specific people in the DnD Discord server said that coffee is cringe, which is FALSE!!! Coffee is amazing. If you need to wake yourself up quickly, drink a cup of coffee. It's what I do every single day before I go to school. Which is nice as I do not get adequate hours of sleep. Fun! AAAnd if you add that yummy shit to it (creamer) then it tastes even better. I personally don't like drinking black coffee, so I add the yummy shit to it. It's very nice. Very. Recently, our school has started the process of selecting our classes for next year. I don't think I go until next Thursday, so I have some time to decide what I wanna do next year. I wanna try to be in the same classes as my friends, but that can be difficult to plan and successfully execute. First we have to get into the same class with the same teacher, and THEN we gotta get into the same period. I don't think there's a definite strategy, so it's mostly based on submitting our forms first and hoping the teacher (or whoever decides it) puts us into the same period. I think I might try doing this filming class I did when I was in 6th grade again, as I do have a YouTube channel so I can get my mind used to Premiere Pro again. For now, I just use Shotcut to edit my videos. It's alright, it gets the job done at least. And, it's FREEEEEEEEEEEEE so that's a plus. Only 4 minutes until we're released to lunch. I love lunch, I love eating food. It's so Food. Yeah. I don't know, I'm just trying to add characters. wasd! The gamer letters... There's also arrow keys but those are only used for RPGs typically. I wonder when Undertale 2 is coming out... Actually, I wonder when the rest of Deltarune is coming out as well. It's gonna be so Epic. Alright, it's about time to go now, so now I go to time. What!!!!!!

Well Im in a boring class. So boring. So so. So SO? What. I don't know, man! Stop asking me shit! And go back to Starbucks, where you BELONG! Haha, hashtag roasted... Yeah, just spouting random nonsense again as per usual. Well, maybe not THAT usual, but somewhat usual. Or, maybe it's... unusual? Anyway, yeah I'm in kinda like a study hall class but not really. It's only 30 minutes instead of the typical 70 minutes our usual classes are. Yeah. Well, recently I've started a new epic server for my friends and I named the Soy SMP. It's So Fun. I'm having a Blast. We used to play on 1.12.2, but then changed to 1.16.5 as that got boring (well they found 1.12.2 boring I still liked it) and THEN switched to the most recent version at this current point in time, 1.19.4. I was originally against the idea of adding the Caves and Cliffs update to the server, as I didn't like the way caves were changed. However, that opinion has changed now, and I actually like the CaC update now. It's quite fun exploring the deep caves, especially where it all consists of deepslate. There's actually a ton of diamonds down there. My friend(s) and I went down there a few days ago and I hauled around 18 diamonds, all of which I found through mining ores. So, yeah, that's really good. However, it's kinda useless to find those diamonds now as we already have enchanted diamond armor and tools that we got from Pink-ish Pickler trading with a lot of villagers. In fact, we stole all of the villagers from their home village and imprisoned them in a trading hall we have at our base. Now, if anyone besides Pink-ish Pickler and I wants to trade with our villagers, they're gonna have to come to us. I don't really know if we've invoked a system of them giving us stuff and we giving the villager loot in return but that would be fun I believe. Yeah, we should introduce capitalism to the Soy SMP! So fun! Also, during that diamond haul that I got exploring those caves, we actually found an ancient city. The loot there was alright, nothing insane but still some good loot. I got a few disc fragments for that new disc that was added and my friend got some enchanted diamond leggings or something. I also found this completely stacked pair of leggings with Mending, Unbreaking III, and Protection IV I believe but they were iron. So, maybe I'll grind it in the grindstone for Thy XP but maybe not. I've set up a zombie farm using this dungeon I found, and that gives around a level per 5 minutes of AFK-ing and killing the zombies in the farm. I looked up the design on YouTube as I had literally no idea how to make one and the tutorial on the Minecraft wiki seemed un-nessecarily complicated. Either that or I'm just too STUPID to read it. Anyway, the current things on the agenda are to get full netherite armor and tools (which we've already done some progress on) and to kill the ender dragon. We have all the materials to go to the end (maybe a little too much) but the thing that's stopping us is that I'd like to get everyone that (somewhat) regularly plays the server to join us in the slaying of the dragon. Sounds easy, right? Well, when you're a high school student that fucking sucks at dedicating time to complete assignments on time, not so much. That isn't just about me, either. There are SOME people (who shall not be named but maybe in the near future if I hate them enough) that can relate to that statement that ALSO play the server regularly. So, I'd say the best chance to do this is on the weekend, but that could also be problematic for those who have family that actually care about them. So it's basically a huge game of... what's the right metaphor to describe this... Tag? Duck Duck Goose? Idfk man, it's just difficult to get them all on the server at once. We've only done it once before, and that was either during winter break or our few snow days we had a while back. Plus, some may just not be interested in playing on the server at the time others wish, so even more issues with that. BUT! I promise to all of you (2 people) that WE shall beat the ender dragon with ALL of us. Or maybe I'll just do it on my own lol. Also, it appears that Herobrine is haunting the server. In the first video that Good Friend Harry and I recorded on the server, he spawned in our stupid strip mine thing and we got Very Scared. It was truly haunting. Maybe I'll post the clip on YouTube and link it here, but I'm at school right now and the video is on my PC so, yeah, kinda hard to do that. However, it seems he's escaped the mine we trapped him in and is now haunting us just outside our line of sight. Here's a screenshot of him lurking (near the top right) and another towards the top left instead (and also the community house which Pink-ish Pickler built with her INSANE building talent which she claims that the house is just a mere fraction of her capability actually I'm not completely sure she said that but idk this is getting too long). Anyway, I probably have some more to say but I just can't think of it right now. I might or might not update this later today, but favors are in the latter. See You Next

whats app guys welcome back to another Video today we re gonna kill. Yeah!!!!!!! I love KILL!!!!! Wake up and wake up the wake up . I dont kno w what im saying so this may be confusing to some audiences. Proceed if YOU DARE!! yeah i dont know what im doing with my life right now, I'm supposed to be studying for a math quiz I have tomorrow BUT i don't feel like it lol. Maybe thats why my grades suck ass! Anyway, I do things. These things consist of Nothing, Nothing, and last but most certainly least, NOTHING!!!!! brain is not functioning Why! I saw this cool minecraft mod on youtube the other day, it was called like "Modern Beta" or something. It enables one to generate a world in previous eras of Minecraft's world generation system so thats kinda cool I guess. I was gonna play with it for a bit but I got distracted doing something else. What? Oh, I don't know. I can't remember. Like I said, brain broke. Brain break. What? No, I don't eat that kind of SALAD. It's literally just lettuce, what the hell. I tried salad for the first time in 30 years yesterday, it was Ok. Just ok, still tasted like leaves but I guess That is what it is. I'm trying to think, shut up for a sec! Wait, did you say you like roast beef? ME too! ...my friend is sick so he's an L honestly. aeiou Aeiou AEiou aeIou. Im fun. Y'know, something that's been on my mind recently is that in real life, i'm a fuckin loser But in the World of Online Games, im cool. It's crazy, kinda. Maybe. Something to think about. I wish i could transfer that coolness over to my real life but it doesn't work that way!!! I don't know what the HELL pink pickle is doing But its probably soemthing. Oh I've run out of things to say, Gotta Go!!! Maybe. Possibly. I'm getting close to full netherite armor on my server, I've already upgraded my chestplate and leggings, along with my sword and pickaxe. The enchantments i got on those pieces of equipment is kinda Wacko. Very wacko. I won't say specifically what they are, because I don't want to. Lol. We only have like uhhh 2 minutes left of this class it sucks. It also kinda doesn't suck as today our classes are shortened to around 30 minutes, but it also do suck as we have all of our classes today. So, for some specific classes I'm not gonna be so happy, and the reverse for some others. I went to the dentist on the weekend. Apparently my teeth are all FUCKED UP!!! Well, not to that extent (maybe). But they had to fill some holes in my teeth which is cool I guess. However, they only did the right side of my mouth so I gotta go back AGAIN to fill the holes in the left side of my mouth. And then I'll need to take good care of my teeth from then on, unlike what younger me did. Screw you younger me! Anyway yeah i think thats it now because im Sdumb. bye

Hey guys, this is a little test just to see if I stole code correctly or not. YAAAAAAAY!

alright looks like I did... only like the 4th time I've stolen code that is. anyway HI HELLO!!! Welcome back to Mckenzie LTE real. Oh yeah, it's LTEing time. Anyway, as some of you may or may not notice, I've finally fixed that darn little Character Counter!!! It doesn't really look like it's changed at all, but under the hood I've COMPLETELY REWRITTEN IT!!! By that I mean I stole code lol. Yeah, imagine writing your own code, couldn't be me... Anyway, the way I fixed it was using this little thing called ChatGPT! I know I know, yes I used the funny chat bot to fix my code for me BUT!!!! I do not care if you dislike this action or not, because honestly I couldn't exactly figure it out on my own by just looking at some Stack Overflow posts or just crawling the various pages of Google. So, I decided to do something more direct. Yes, I could've asked an actual person for this, but as you all know I suck at social interraction. AAND there was probably the chance of I not even getting what I wanted in the first place. Pink-ish Pickler actually gave me the idea to use ChatGPT to write some code, so thanks Pink-ish Pickler!!! She also tried to help me by telling it to do exactly what the counter does, but then I told it to do that but better so HA! I might even use it to fix the kinda buggy site style thing... but that's for later!!! Anyway, now I don't have to edit the javascript everytime I write an entry. So epic. I originally attempted to steal some of Knocktons code but that kinda fell flat. Speaking of Knockton, they haven't updated their LTE in over 2 weeks... I wonder if they're okay. I mean, they probably are. They're just prioritizing on school I assume, which I don't blame them for. But me? I don't got time for that!!! Sure, my life is rapidly going down a bad path by doing this, but I get to write on the funny websight so it's worth it. I'm hungry. Oh, that reminds me. Yesterday in DND club, one of our club members brought popsicles and gave some to all of us. It was quite nice, even though it's the middle of March, but whatever. Anyway, I think we all got at least 2. One was one of those dual popsicles (i got grape flavor) and another one I didn't see what it was specifically but I think it was just a single. So, I tried to eat the dual popsicle but it burst into two when I tried to separate one. Now, I had one piece that had both sticks in them, and the other had no stick. I decided to eat the piece that had the sticks in them as it would be easier, and I threw the rest away because club was over and I couldn't eat in the car going home. But, for the second popsicle I got, I decided to just put in my lunchbox and eat it when I got home. However, I forgot I put it in my lunchbox and I didn't eat it. Turns out the next day, that same popsicle melted and apparently some of it escaped the confines of the lunchbox (the melted portions at least). If you don't know, paper-like materials and melted popsicles don't really work well together. But from what it looks like, nothing was really damaged so... I guess I got lucky. Anyway, that's probably all I have to write for today, so BYE!!!

oi whaddup, Gonna write cause I can. Not much has really happened recently, well anything of big importance at least. I added a little thing in the javascript that changes the welcome text at the top depending on the specific day. I only added a few special days, so you'll only see it on those (which I will not elaborate on what those specific days are LOL). Good Friend Harry introduced me to a new game recently as, if you didn't know, EXP Simulator got blocked on the school computers recently. I'm kinda glad as Harry can't flex his STUPID LITTLE STATS on that STUPID LITTLE GAME 24/7. Anyway, the game's called "Prestige Tree" and it's pretty fun. If I'm being honest, it might be a little more fun than EXP Simulator, but I don't know, I haven't progressed much in the game. I'm ahead of Harry though, so I got that going for me. Harry if you're reading this then HAHAHAHA IM BETTER AT PRESTIGE TREE THAN YOU!!!!! Anyway, here's the link if you wanna check it out. Hmm, what else... Oh, right. You know that one Minecraft resource pack I was making. Well, I accidentally deleted it while cleaning up my MultiMC instances. It's fine, I didn't really get that far in the pack anyway. I might try to make it again in the future, but I'm not very motivated to do so right now. Knockton updated their LTE a few days ago. It's funny, cause I think an hour or two after I last updated my LTE, they updated theirs. That's happened a few times actually. It's a little strange... Anyway, it's good to know they're not dead or anything. So, go READ IT!!!!! It's on the LTE Hub!!!! okay Bye.

hi Hi guys Guys. Writing some more because I got nothin to do. Actually, I do have things to do but it's just that everyone in this class seems to hate me, so not really I guess. We're supposed to be combining some of our solo dances we made a few weeks ago into a duet, but it's kinda hard to do that with the previously mentioned issue. And yes, I'm in a dance class even though my feet don't work correctly. It's not like I chose it for dance itself, it's a required thing one needs to take in order to graduate. Don't get me wrong, dance as an artform is fine and I won't stop others from enjoying that just because I personally don't enjoy it, I'm not THAT much of a dick. Just kinda sucks that it's required to take at this school, especially for people like me. Anyway, I was going to leak some drama to the general populace that are you readers of this LTE, but I've decided against it. Also, it's the next day now. Yeah, classes on Monday only last around 30 minutes instead of the typical 75. Okay, now it's the Next Next day. Yeah, that's right. I've officially worked on this entry for 3 days now. I'll probably post it today though, so you guys don't have to wait another 599 years for me to update my LTE. I pretty much spent the last 15 minutes thinking about what I want to talk about, and I still don't know what I want to talk about. Bruh!!! Now there's only 5 minutes left of my class. Bruh!!! Next I have lunch. Not bruh!!! Alright, I'm actually working on the gallery thing I (probably) said I'd work on so YA!!!! Also I may or may not do some work on that LTE Rules page I said I'd make like forever ago since I'm bored and I can't really think of what to write right now LOLE. BAYA!!!!!

yo what s up guys Im back! After a long while of 1 week, I hath returne. Spring Break went by quite fast for me as I did pretty much nothing over the course of our week off. Basically just played games all week (as per usual). At the time of writing this, we have only 5.449315 calendar years until the end of the world. I'm so HYPED!!!! I can't wait until the end of the world, it'll be so Lit. Hi, it's the tomorrow now. My legs hurt from the angle they've been in for the past hour or so. I know that sentence probably sounds strange, but I don't really know any other way to word it. And would ya look at that! It's the next NEXT day! So COOL!!!!! What to talk about Lol i dont know hahahahahhashajhaejhqefujhbwegjhwewejhwehwebhuw.emne Sorry. Stupid Creative Cloud keeps giving me useless notifications and it's ANNOYING!!!! Thing is, I can't turn off the automatic start on boot because this is the school laptop and not my regular laptop, meaning I do not have administrator privileges. GOSH DANG IT!!!! Actually... I'm not completely sure one needs admin to change those settings. Let me try... aaaand I was right, I can't change it here. BOOOOOOOO!! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! ok. Today is a 2-hour early release CAUSE we got conferences. Let me just say, I don't think my grades right now are Quite Good. I think they're Quite Bad, actually. So, I'd say I'm kinda screwed. But, enough of that. Remember that gallery thing I was working on? Well, I'd say it's in a good enough state to be finally released to the public! Course, it's not FULLY complete but I'll update it over time. There's still some digital drawings I've yet to put up there. Actually, I might make two separate categories for the gallery, one being traditional and the other beign digital. Maybe, it depends on the ratio on traditional drawings vs. digital drawings. Well, I can't think of anything else to talk about at this current moment in time so I guess I'll end it here. OH!!! Go check out Pink-ish Pickle LTE and Knockton's Potato LTE, THEY UPDATED!!!!!! LINKS IN LTE HUB!!!!!!!!!!!!! by

THREE WEEKS!!! GIVE IT UP FOR THREE WEEKS!!! Three weeks have passed since my last update to this site. Quite a while, hmm?? Yeah, sorry for the absence. I guess I was getting a little burnt out on updating my LTE. BUT! Don't think I've been completely slacking off...! I've actually been working on a little co-op project with the Pink-ish Pickler. That's right, the two greatest minds in all of the world working together!! ...okay maybe I'm being a little TOO egotistical, BUT STILL! It's good to have some self-confidence! But it's also good to not be completely full of yourself. It's a balance that I believe every person needs to practice. ooooo aaaaaaa im being spiritual now or Whatever. But still, it's good to have both of those (in moderation). What was I talking about again...? OH right, the project that we're working on. I'll give a quick rundown. Basically, every week our school puts out a weekly schedule that lists the current classes with times for the days, showcases if we have any, and any before or after school events such as clubs. The only ways a student is able to view the schedule is to A) view the weekly newsletter that is sent out every Sunday morning via email and hosted on Smore.com, B) go to the schools official website and go through a bunch of pages to view the schedule, or C) locate one of the few physical papers with the schedule in the school (which they never tell us where those are). We (pickler and I) think that the current ways of viewing the schedule are inconvenient. Sure, they work, but it's just TOOOOO MUUUUCH WOOOORK, and the current generation of kiddins (us included) aren't typically willing to put in that much work to view the schedule. SOO, we instead opted to make a Neocities website for that sole purpose! That way, one could just go to that simple URL and view the weekly schedule with no hassle! Wow, I'm so good at pitching ideas. I wish that skill could transfer into the real world instead of just text! Anyway, I'm not gonna include the link unfortunately as I would basically be doxxing myself (or the school I go to anyway) and I don't wanna do that again! Although I don't think anyones noticed the first time I've accidentally doxed myself before, and I'm gonna try to keep it that way. Now, what else... Actually, there's something I thought of yesterday and I'd like to share my thoughts on it. The difference between a 'programmer' and a 'coder'. For a while, I've thought that these words mean basically the same thing. But then, I used my brain. Shocking, I know! But I used my brain, and the results are... kinda wack, bro. I believe that the difference between a 'programmer' and a 'coder' is that a 'programmer' writes code professionally or for business, like a job or something, while a 'coder' writes code unprofessionally or for fun, such as personal projects like this website for example. Not saying that skill is interpreted by these two titles, just that this is what I think these titles signify what specific people who write code want to accomplish... if that makes sense. It probably doesn't, but much doesn't make sense in this LTE now does it? I've noticed that Knockton still has been updating their LTE despite our hiatuses and I have to say, I respect the hustle. To be fair, I did basically the same thing when Pink-ish Pickler wasn't updating like a year or two ago, but still! It's good to keep staying active on your LTE despite others not doing the same (ahem pink pickle ahem). Y'know, it's funny. A while back it was I who was slacking on updating my LTE and Pink Pickle yelling at everyone to update their LTEs. Ah, how time passes... I love it when time passes, unless it's not in my favor then I HATE IT!!! But typically, that isn't the case. Thank gosh golly gee! I have to say, recently my writing hasn't been my strongest. Well, it's never been my strongest but nowadays I'm having trouble just... writing things. Like, I can word them near perfectly in my head, but when I want to write it out I just... can't? Either that or it's an extremely watered down version of what I had in my head. I don't really know why this is the case... I'm not one to assume that I have a mental illness based on, well, nothing really. But it has been on my mind. I already have a physical disability, I don't need a mental one too!!! I read a comment from somewhere that I can't remember, but it was some obscure website I think. Anyway, this one person was asking a question like, "I'm having trouble writing this script for my video, anyone have any tips?" And this one person replied, "From what I learned in (some sort of english class), it's easier to edit existing text than to write from scratch. Even if what you write first is awful, I always found it easier to edit it later." ...or something like that. Again, I don't really remember all the details. But this piece of advice has kinda changed the way I think about writing. For better or for worse, I can't really tell. On a unrelated note, I'm gonna talk about Twitter now!!!! So fun!!! Anyway, as horrible as a platform (and to extention, the people that live off of it) it is, it's kind of addicting. Y'know, just to view the daily trending posts for the day that aren't related to politics or whatever, cause that shit is boring AF. There are some posts that I've seen on there that did get a chuckle out of me, or just things I found interesting. I kinda just browse it whenever I'm bored and I don't know what to do. Don't worry I don't use it daily, I'm not that depraved. But now that I think about it, I do have an old twitter account I made some odd years ago. ...oh god, am I turning into a Twitter user? Oh, oh god NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! Eh, probably not. It's not like I've used Twitter for the sake of interacting with other people, I just use Real Life to do that! But I think this can prove a point that nearly every social media platform has at least 1 good thing about it that can benefit the user. Except for Facebook. That platform is ASS. Why? well my MOTHER got HACKED on FACEBOOK!!! How could they do this to my poor mother... evil facebook hackers. Recently neither of my two good buddy friend chum pals have been at DND club so I haven't been going either. If I'm being honest, the whole reason I went to DND club was just to hang out with my friends some more. I didn't care that much about doing actual DND if it wasn't with my good buds. Don't get me wrong, I don't think DND is a bad game or anything, I'm just not that invested in it as some of the other people in the club. We haven't really been doing much actual DND either, even if my good friend buddy chums are there. We pretty much just do whatever I guess. It gets kind of boring at times since we have 2 hours and we're still under regular school supervision. I mean, we have a little more freedom that we do during the school day but not by much. I'm gonna end this entry here as I've written quite a lot. I'd love to keep writing more, but I've kind of run out of ideas. Plus it's only 9 minutes until we get out of school sooooo.... ya. I might write some more this week or the next, but finals are gonna be kicking my ass pretty soon so I wouldn't count on it. Hopefully I git gud... alright bye guys make sure to Liek and ScrubScribe. PEACE!!!

Almost 4 months since my last entry, but it's fine. It's whateva. I guess!? What's Up Guys!!!! IIIII'm Baaaaack!!! Did you guys miss me??????? Probably not, or maybe you did, I don't know. I can't really tell what you readers think of me. Probably because theres no comment section for my website! Well, actually... there IS! The neocities uhhh shout out uhhh comment thing. I don't know what it's called, so I'm just going to call it that. HA HA! This is so XD guys! This is filler! I need more characters! Yeah man. I love me some characters. Okay, let's see... what have I been up to these past 4 months? I'm trying to recall... but my memory... is bad... One thing I guess I should mention is that I'm a junior now! Yeah, that's right!!! Just this year and the next and then I'll be out of school! Unless I plan to go to college or something. I don't really know my plan on that yet... Hell, I don't even know what I'd do if I went to college. Maybe I could take some sort of computer programming class or something? Although from what I've heard, they don't really teach you anything you can't learn using free online resources. I mean, yeah sure it's a good hands-on experience if you don't really know what you want to do with that skill, but I already know what I wanna do with this skill. Update this website, of course! Well, getting ideas on what to add to this website can be difficult, but making new LTE entries really isn't. OH, speaking of LTEs... I'm actually working on that LTE rules page I promised literally 3 years ago! Jeez, I just realized how long ago 3 years was. Time sure does fly, doesn't it? Or rather, "Fireflies When You're Having Fun" if you're well versed in LBP2 terms. Actually, that would be a good thing to talk about. My unbridled love and affection for the hit game LittleBigPlanet 2! I used to play the game a lot, and I mean A LOT, when I was younger. I'd go as far to say it basically shaped my childhood. It's a shame that the online servers were shut down 1-2 years ago. I think there might be community servers, but I'm not sure. I don't really play the game anymore, nor do I really play my PS3 anymore either. I wonder where all my PlayStation friends are in life now...? I wish I could check how many hours I've spent in the game, but I don't think that's tracked on PS3. At least, not without homebrew or something. Actually, I did homebrew my PS3 a while back but it was after all those years I spent playing LBP2. But I don't know for sure, maybe it was tracked. I'll have to look that up later. If I had to make an estimate however, I'd say it would probably be over 1K hours. Of course, that's just an estimate so it might be lower or it might be higher. I won't really know for sure unless I'm able to find that time played statistic if it exists. I'd highly recommend to play the LBP series if you haven't already, it is the definition of goated. Well, at least the first and second game are. I'm not so sure about the third. Last time I played the third game, it was a buggy mess that crashed every 10 minutes. But I don't know, maybe Sumo Digital actually got competent and fixed all those bugs. (had to check if i spelled competent right and i did YAAAAAAY) Still, definitely play the first and second games. Hmm, what else to talk about... oh right I was talking about the LTE rules page until I went on that monologue about LBP2. Uhhh yeah, sorry not sorry, more characters for me! Anyway, about the rules page... I've decided I'm not making it just a rules page, but a general 'about page' which just explains a few things about what LTEs are and some specific terms I guess? I'm still working on it, so I'll post a link to it in the next entry if I have it done by then. Also, just wanted to say that I did have a original version of this entry specifically that was a little different than what's actually here, but I LOST IT because my STUPID SCHOOL LAPTOP restarted GOOGLE CHROME for LITERALLY NO REASON and DIDN'T SAVE THE ENTRY I WAS WRITING!!!!!!!!! The reason it didn't save is because I write my entries directly into the Neocities text editor instead on something like Google Docs or Notepad because I find it easier. Unfortunately that comes with a caveat, as stated before. Still mad about it erasing my entire entry... but I guess it's whatever. Can't do nothin' about it now! Plus, this current entry is longer than the one I had before so it's okay I guess. maaaan i dont know what to write about maaaaan Bruh Bruh. Yeah Im gonna probably work on this entry tomorrow just cause I wanna add more characters to this entry before posting it LOL OLO LOL OLOLLLLLOOLLO LO! Actually maybe not I'm not sure. I feel very inclined to copy and paste a random songs lyrics or an entire wikipedia article here BUT I would be a hypocrite. Hahahaha i accidentally typed hypocrate and I thought to myself "Haha hypocrate more like hippocrate" and then i looked up hippocrate and found out that he was a greek physician... whatever that is. I thought that was funny enough to put here LOL. LMAO!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH ok. Sometimes I do a laugh that sounds like a windshield wiper and i think thats very funny. I don't think my friends find it funny however. I don't blame them though, as I basically do it every 5 minutes. Yeah I can't really think of anything meaningful to write. I mean, I did have some ideas on what to write about before I went to lunch. But, I guess they've disappeared from my brain. FUN!!! Sometimes I have difficulty choosing between options that I'm given in a question/query. I think I'm just slow. As Sonic Says, "Thaaaat's no good!" I've been playing a lot of Flow Free recently. I played it in short intervals last year, but NOW I've gone full throttle. I play Flow Free everyday at this point. It's become an addiction. One that I cannot and will not stop. Until I am done. With the game, of course. I AM THE MIST AND YOU ARE THE FOG!!!!!! I just thought that up now. I don't know what it means. I don't want to know what it means. But, it's something that's for sure. I keep forgetting that where I am in the school building right now is basically a deadzone so I can't send voices messages that make no sense at all and are literally just me making random ass noises to my best buddies. NOO!!!!!!!! I've also been replaying all of the Snail Bob games as well. I've only gotten through the first two games and I'm currently through half of the third one I believe. The games are kind of buggy though, as they're Flash games and Flash was deprecated like 2-3 years ago? Not sure about the date, but it was a while ago. Anyway, yeah I've been using the Ruffle emulator since I can't really run standalone exe files on my school laptop as the school administrators were smart and set up a whitelist for what applications can be run without administrator priviledges. Although, I do remember watching a video showcasing how one could bruteforce getting admin without needing a password but I don't feel comfortable trying that on my school computer as they basically watch everything I do using this program called Lightspeed. Basically, from what I understand, it's essentially like TaskViewer (a tech support program that allows "technicians" to remotely access your computer) but for monitoring students. I think they log basically everything. Keystrokes, applications run, you get the gist. I'm surprised I haven't been flagged for anything I've said on here, but to be fair I've only typed a fair share of swears, not anything really serious. I did get flagged a while ago for this presentation I made which was very... crude to say the least. I wish I had a copy of it still but I deleted it because, y'know. Back to Snail Bob, I used to play the games a lot in elementary school, especially in the morning as we had free time to go onto the library computers and just do whatever I guess. Well, whatever that was permitted in school that is. Fortunately, we had a large selection of Educational Games to play!!! We mostly played on Math Playground as I think Cool Math Games was blocked, not sure though. It is blocked currently, but I have no idea if it was blocked back then. We also played this math game called Prodigy. It was basically this RPG but you fight enemies by answering math problems. I personally think that's a good way to incentivize kids to practice math more. And the thing is, it did! For me, at least. I was HOOKED to the game in elementary school. I think we stopped using it after 4th or 5th grade though, which sucks cause I really liked the game. I wonder if I'm able to access my old account... I'll have to try that, but I think I had a custom username or password set up for it so I don't know if I'll be able to. Or maybe I should just make a new account... I might, if I have the time. Already a month in and our grades are already due for a progress check. Bruh!!! I'm going to try to stay on top of things this year as last year was basically a big drop in my GPA. So, that might mean no more weekly entries guys... I might have to go to every OTHER week. I know, I know, you're all upset. BUT, it'll be fine! I promise. (with my fingers crossed behind my back) Anyway, I think that might be it for this entry. I feel this is a good stopping point for my humble return. Also, Pink-ish Pickler updated her LTE and her main site too!!! Apparently she added her MUSIC!?!??!?! That she COMPOSED!?!?!??! WhAAAAAAT!?!?!?!??! I haven't listened to it yet, but I probably will tonight and maybe make a small entry discussing my thoughts on it. Or not. But I'll listen to her music!!! Because that's what friends do!!! Thumbs Up!!! yea so go check out Pink Pickle Website NOW!!! or else i will consume your Rotting Flesh and Bones from your Carcass. Bye 😀

okay i guess im Updating this now cause STewpid little pickler is cursing me out saying that she wishes that I FAIL this Year and I dont like that Why would you wish that upon me you little rat I hope that you fail this year as well cause my gpa is at a One point EIGHT just cause of last year im so effing mad grrrrr gruuuug MMMMMMMMMMMMM im not updating my lte anymore im cancelling the lte foundation im done go home goodbye GET OUT

Just kidding!!! Hahaha, yeah, I GOT you guys didn't I?!? To make you think that I'd stop updating my LTE... ha! Not in a million years. ...actually that's a lie I'll probably stop updating this when I feel it's done but ANYWAY!!! I'm not gonna stop updating my LTE anytime soon, so don't fret dear readers! I plan to stay for at least 2 more years until I (hopefully) graduate high school. Then I don't know, maybe I'll get a job, maybe I'll just sit on my ass all day doing nothing, we'll see. Also, I want to apologize for not updating this as often as I did last year. I just haven't really found the time to properly write any moderately long entries as I do actually plan to get my shit together this year. Plus, study hall is a lot more strict than last year. Well, I don't know if 'strict' is the correct word, but I just can't really find the time to write without getting bugged about missing assignments that mean literally nothing to my grade. So, fun! Anyway, that's probably all I'll write for today. I know, I know, short entry. But, as I said, I can't really find the time to write in school, so maybe I'll start writing during my free time after school? I don't know... anyway Pickler LTE updated, READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good night

Hey gamers. It's me, ya boy! Back at it again, at Krispy Kreme. (and then I do like a triple backflip and break the Krispy Kreme sign or something) man I miss Vine. I know I could just watch Vine compilations on YouTube, but it doesn't feel the same as when Vine was still up and running. I think I heard a rumor a year or two ago about Vine's potential return but I don't think it went anywhere. I'm still thinking whether or not I should start updating this outside of school. I'm sure Pink-ish Pickler would want me to, buuuuuuuuut I don't really feeeeeeeeeeel like iiiiiiiiiiiiiiit........ I have better things to do after school! Like! Watch YouTube videos! For 6 hours! or something... I have been working on a few coding projects, but I'm not going to reveal them. In fact, I've been going under a different alias for these specific projects as... well I don't really know. I guess I like privacy? Maybe? I've always been weird about using the same name for different communities and I don't really know why. Maybe I get a overarching sense of fear when I think about the possibility that someone might be cyberstalking me or something, even though literally nobody knows who I am... HA! HAHA! I guess that's why I like privacy as I haven't really had a proper reason to open up about certain things. One small fact that I'm sure is veeery surprising: I don't have many friends. For most of my middle school years, I literally knew nobody in my school. I mean, I did know people, but they didn't know me (if that makes sense). I had nobody I only really started to develop a friend group in my 9th grade year as, another small fact that I'm sure is also veeery surprising: I'm not very extroverted. Basically the total opposite in regards to meeting new people. If only I could force myself to not be such a LLLoser... uhhh google chrome did this really weird thing where it just... disappeared? Man, these school laptops suck Absolute ass. The thing is, most of its specs are pretty good for what? A $400 laptop? The only thing holding it back is its CPU, which SUUUUUUCKS!!! I can't remember specifically what CPU it is, but I know it's very low end. Also, the GPU isn't great either. I think it's just a basic Intel Integrated Graphics GPU or whatever it's called. It gets the job done for most applications though so I don't really mind. I'm trying to force myself to not type swears as much as I'm currently writing this in Study Hall where the teacher has this little program that allows her to see all and know all basically. I'm not really up to getting sent to the office (even if I'm a junior lolol). ummmm what else to write about... I don't really know!!! Our school is doing this thing where we walk on the track for our entire lunch dressed in our halloween costumes to... raise money for something I think. I don't really remember what... Classic me, forgetting small details! Hahahaha... I should probably get that checked out. I didn't dress in a costume this year as I didn't really care and I don't think we even have the money to afford at least a somewhat good-looking costume. A lot of our bills were due last week and we're still trying to catch up... I can't believe that the average rent for a house is something around $1,500. We don't even live in a rich neighborhood!!! We have a small ass house!!! What the hell!!! To be fair, I know basically nothing about housing or that market soooo Ya. Just take that with a grain of salt I guess. I watched the FNaF movie last weekend. It was alright I guess. It wasn't terrible in my opinion, but it was certainly lacking (mostly with the plot). It really did seem like a lot of the characters were just introduced to just be killed off with little to no importance to the actual story. I did have a few other complaints about the plot, but I won't really get into them here. At least, not for now. I don't have the energy. I will say, the animatronics themselves looked cool. Not completely game-accurate, but it's fine. Can't really expect much from a film with a $20 million budget. I think I read somewhere that the average movie has a budget between $50 and $100 million, so I can understand why some visual differences were apparent. Plot definitely needs to be improved though. Argg!!!! I keep running out of topics to write about. Sometimes I feel I should just talk about things that make no apparent sense at all just to increase the character count. That reminds me, I should probably update the hub soon. I don't think that there's been any new LTEs, but character counts probably need to be updated. Especially for Pink-ish Pickler's LTE. Daily entries for a week... man I could never achieve that. At least, in the state that I'm in now school-wise. I never really have time in my classes to update my LTE as I'm either A) Working on assignments, B) Doing a class activity (which they're dum i hate them especially when we have to talk to other people😡😡😡) or C) All of the above!!! So fun guys. For some reason my laptop just opened up Snipping Tool??? What???????? Sometimes I wonder how different my life would be if I went to a normal, public high school. Would I have a lot of friends? Would I be bullied constantly? I don't really know. I had a mix of both of those in elementary school, so maybe it would've been the same as back then. But hey, that's just a theory... a LIFE THEORY! Thanks for watching! that would make the perfect ending for this entry... but i still have 10 minutes left in this class... Hmmm, an interesting query indeed! What's that sound? It seems to be screaming! Everything's seeming slightly strange... Honest opinion, the FNaF movie would've been much better if it was more like FNaF The Musical by Random Encounters. That musical is honestly the best piece of FNaF content I have ever seen in my life. You guys should watch it if you haven't already. q! I love q! What is q? I'm not so sure. But, that's for you to know and me to find out! Ha Ha Ha. haHAHa. I just noticed that this poster to the left of me has only three thumbtacks holding it on the wall. I wonder where the fourth went... I have to remember to update the raw version of this LTE when I post this entry. Maybe I should make it so that the page does some JavaScript trickery where it just takes all the p tags in the lte div of this page and arranges it so that it's just one continuous page. I still need to learn about getting content from other pages though... I was planning to do something similar for the character counts on the LTE hub but I couldn't figure it out. Maybe I'll come back to it so that I wouldn't have to update the character counts every 5 seconds. It smells like popcorn in here... It's kind of funny that the whole purpose of study hall is to get work done, but last year I basically just used it to update my LTE and procrastinate. Luckily I've been a little better on not procrastinating, but at the cost of updating this LTE more often. I think it's a fair trade. Pickler doesn't think so. Well, I DON'T CARE!!!!!!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAAHHHHHAHAHHAHAAAHHAHAHAHHAHAH cough HAHAHHAAAHHHAAHAHAHAAAHAAHHHAAAAA!!!!! Speaking of the PICKLER, she updated her LTE. Check it or I'll break your neck! oh also happy halloween :) boye boye

Hey guys Whats up guys! Writing today cause it's a short day here at the school and... I forgot what I was going to say! Fun!!! I've recently been working on improving the JavaScript used for this page and turns out there was a problem with the old profanity filter thing! Basically, something went wrong with it and if it were to be enabled, it would basically cause every other function in the JS to not work. At all. Yeah, that's probably not good to have... Credit to the Pickler for finding this bug for me!!! Also, it essentially removed all of the line breaks in the LTE itself and made it a giant wall of text. (which I guess is pretty normal for LTEs, but not for mine!) So, I managed to fix it mostly. The reason I say that is because there's still one problem that still persists. When the profanity filter is enabled, all of the links in the LTE just... disappear? For some reason??? I tried searching for a problem similar to this online and one of the problems that was listed was something about innerText and TextContent. I can't look up what specifically right now as... for some reason Google isn't working. It just keeps saying 'Connection closed'. bruh!!! I'll go to the library after I finish backing up everything on my school laptop to Google Drive... ANYWAY, I changed something with the innerText/TextContent thing and it still breaks the links so I don't know. I'm not smart enough for this!!!! hahah thats a joke im VERY smart. The thing with Google is strange though... I've been cleaning up Pickler's LTE html file because looking at the formatting for it... I just... UGH!!!!! GROSS!!!!! WHY DOES SHE DO IT LIKE THAT!!!!?????!!!?? So, I'm being a good friend and cleaning it up for her because GOD, it is horrid. I know formatting doesn't really matter, but still. I think it's good to have a clean html to work with rather than a messy one. Makes it easier on the brain, ya know? Also, there were several errors in her html file so I fixed those too. Wow! I'm such a good friend! Man, I wonder why people don't want to be friends with me... I'm like, THE BEST. (joking if you couldn't tell xd xd) Four more minutes left of class! Yay! I'm so excited! You know what else I'm excited for? CHRISTMAS!!!!! (yes I know it's not even december yet Shut up) Who needs a stupid turkey when you get FREE STUFF!!!! It's even better when you don't have to get stuff for other people either!!! HAhahahahaha... ummmmm uhhhhh Ok im gonna stop here guys. It was fun guys. So fun guys. Fun guys. Funguys. Fungi! Crazy... yeah im bored Ok by

Hi guys Im writing now. Hi writing now Im dad. HAHAHAHAHaHaHaHaHaHahahahahahaha..... I should probably be working on stuff but I don't know. Really. I don't. Stop asking!!! I actually did start writing an entry a little while ago but I didn't post it as it was a little... offputting to say the least. I don't think I'm at that stage yet, so maybe I'll post what's left of it when I am. But right now!!! I'm not!!! So you will NEVER EVER SEE It ever AGAIN!!! Not like you've seen it before... or maybe you have!!! Evil hacker you!!! If you guys couldn't tell, My brain isn't working today. So Im writing Complete Nonsense! To fill up Character Count! Yay! Pickler discovered a secret little GitHub repo made by Jenny (creator of the Ever So Famous 'Flaming Chickens LTE The Original') that was updated pretty recently. Oh, right, I should've probably mentioned that Jenny isn't dead and allat BUT YOU WOULD KNOW if you READ the Pink-ish Pickle LTE!!!! ok hi guys This sentence is from a week later! Yaaay! The reason I couldn't work on this last week is due to a Lot Of Stuff being due and that Lot Of Stuff was quite important to my grade, so I decided to instead focus on that rather than writing a new entry. I know, I'm Sorry!!!! Buut, I'm mostly in a place where I don't gotta worry about that stuff. well, at least for right Now. Hi guys its the other day now. Man, I just cannot find the time to write!! (yes i know i could write outside of school but that's BORING!!!!) anyway What was I talking about again? Oh, right, the github repository thing. We found some... interesting things in the repository, most notably to us a secret folder containing some LTE-related stuff. A lot of the things in the folder from what I remember were these images/drawings that Jenny made. I looked at a few of them and they didn't really seem all that related to LTEs from what I saw but I dunno. Maybe they do have some sort of hidden meaning. Not any that I really recognized... What really intrigued me were a few screenshots with some cryptic names. I don't remember all of them off the top of my head (I would check the repo right now but GitHub is blocked on my school computer for whatever reason and I'm in a class where I can't use my phone) but one that especially piqued my interest was this screenshot named 'mimic' with it being a picture of WhileTrue's LTE, or at least the Google listing of it. I could only speculate on what is could mean as I don't have direct contact with Jenny nor do I really want to discuss this with them, but it's just really strange in my opinion. There were also two text files in the folder as well, one named "remember_me.txt" and the other named "thoughts_on_my_family.txt". I won't go into detail on what these text files state as I'd rather you guys go read it yourself. I'll probably lessen the impact that they have if I attempt to explain what these say sooooo yeah Not doing that! wasd wasd I d. You get what Im saying. I can't think of what. So I won't. j

alright Doing this again! One more time! Just in case you guys aren't aware, I did have an entire entry before this one buut Of Course, My Computer had to Restart. And I Didn't Save. Kind of sucks, especially considering it was one of my longer entries too, but nothing I can do about it now... Also, Happy New YEAR!!! Hopefully 2024 is a better year for me than 2023 was. Well, 2023 wasn't entirely terrible per se... just wasn't my favorite at times. If anything, the latter half of 2023 was really fun! My personal highlight was when my friends and I got to present our Glorious and Wonderful project to everyone in our class. Trust me when I say this... that slideshow... it was the best. Anyway, as they say, New Year New Me. Hahaha! Ohohoho! How joyous! I'm so gleeful! I read a few of my previous entries a while ago, mostly ones from early 2023 and late 2022 and they're kind of... bad? In my opinion of course, but I did write them so... My opinion is superior to all of yours!!! Hahaha! I should probably explain further on what I mean. Something about them just rubs me the wrong way. I don't know... maybe they're a little. Cringe. I think my biggest gripe was that I would always exaggerate my sentences to make it.... 'Unique'. But looking back on it, yeah I don't really like that I did that. I still do it sometimes but not to the extent I used to do it. I've been learning! To be 'normal'! Another thing I didn't really like was how critical I was of everything. Don't get me wrong, I feel it's important to share your opinions even if they are critical of something. But I feel I took it a little bit far sometimes. I wouldn't even be criticizing the thing I was talking about, it would just be pure Hate. Well, maybe not Hate, but a Moderate Amount of Dislike for Something would probably fit better. Maybe I should focus on more positive topics this year. Y'know, spread some Joy! Some Glee! Some Modesty! What would I even talk about though...? Guess I'll have to do some research! ...Soon. Maybe. I don't know when... but I'll try! hopefully... I should probably update the hub soon. I've gotten a few emails so I think it would be an appropriate time. Maybe I'll do it tonight. If I remember! Hahaha! ha... Man I should probably get my weak memory checked out. I don't think that's very 'normal'. I can't believe it's been an entire year since I've written an entry on here! Look I did the joke! Maybe I should've done that earlier in the entry, but Too late now! No going back! It's not like I can redo any of my writing or anything! Nuh uh! Nope! ok im stalling trying to figure out what to write. I need to desperately get Lotsa characters as Pickler is starting to catch up to me...! What?! The Pink-ish Pickle LTE is Updating!? Regularly!? If you would've asked late 2022 me, I woulda gone NUTS!!! AND BOLTS!!! MAYBE SCREWS AS WELL!!! Jokes aside, I'm proud of you Pickler. I can't believe... you're... actually updating... regularly... oh, i'm tearing up... Sob Sob Sob!!! My friends and I have recently been going to the Dairy Queen right by our school to get lunch as we have off-campus passes now. Not gonna lie... Dairy Queen food kind of stomps school food. It's just better. However, Dairy Queen isn't my favorite fast food place... I mean, it's fine. Just not my favorite. Or is it favourite? I think the latter is used by the British exclusively. Well good thing I'm not British! ...i think. I kind of overuse ellipses if you haven't noticed. On an unrelated note but also vaguely related, I'm starting to learn how to drive! Well, I don't start driving school until February, but I've been practicing in a school parking lot! Hopefully everything goes well with that process. Or else, I might be forced to take the bus to travel. Or worse... walk! Hopefully it doesn't come to that. I've been thinking on what to do on the 4th anni-birth-ary of my LTE. Pickler indirectly asked me what I shall plan for her LTE's 4th anni-birth-ary. To answer your question... um.... uh....... I don't know..... Can you come up with something? For me to then propose that thing? Yes, good idea! I have an idea on what I'm gonna do on March 4th! I've been thinking to redesign the hub site to be a little more streamlined. Don't really know if it's going to actually be done, but I'll try I guess. I've a little rusty on my CSS and JavaScript. I should probably update the hub before I redesign it though. I'll probably do it later today. Or tomorrow. Or in a week... I'll get it done eventually!!! Anyway, class is almost out so I'll Cee Yaa Laterr.

Hey guys! Totally haven't been gone for an entire month! Yup! If you're wondering why I didn't update for a month then that's because I got Sick. Really Sick. and it Sucked. Really Sucked. I was sick for around 2-3 weeks and even still I'm recovering from it... I'm confident it was just a cold, but man was it the nastiest cold I've had in years. Seriously, the headaches I had from that sickness were absolutely terrible. That's not even the worst part either. I got sick TWICE!!! From the SAME COLD!!! In less than 3 DAYS!!! So I basically missed two entire weeks from school. Well, that first week was (luckily) all snow days as we got a ton of snow that week. Of course, I didn't go out as I was still sick, but it was nice to stay home and not worry about anything school-related. Well, at least regarding new work I had to make-up. There was still all of my older assignments I had to make-up before the snow week and I had less than a week to do them since it was nearing the end of the semester. So that was fun! (not really) Awkwardly transitioning to the other thing I want to talk about, I'm veery tired today... I got around 4 hours of sleep last night AND the day before as well. So, my brain isn't doing too well right now! I might just make this entry short and maybe write a longer one later. I don't know... Yeah, I think that's what I'm gonna do. Maybe while I sleep I'll come up with some new topics to write about! Maybe! I don't know! Hopefully! Go check out the other LTEs! They probably updated during my absence! Yeah! Bye!

Yeah Im back Again. Sorry for not updating for yet another month... I've been quite busy lately! I started drivers education around the start of this month and I'm supposed to be doing it for five weeks. You may be wondering to yourself, "Five weeks? That's a little short isn't it?" You'd be right! Maybe! I don't really know what the average time a drivers education course lasts in total for, but I've heard that five weeks is relatively short compared to other persons experiences so Ya, Using that as a Base! Anyway, since it's a shorter course I've been needing to go there three times a week for two hours each. Kind of takes quite a bit out of my day considering that I get out of school at 4 PM. Balancing that and doing homework has been a bit challenging, but I've managed! Mostly, anyway. At least it can't get any worse, right? Well, WRONG!!! KIND OF!!! We're also beginning to start our 'Junior Project' since I'm a Junior and I do those things Now. I don't know if any other school does something similar, but at our school juniors and seniors have to complete a project that basically is the thing that we've been building up to ever since we got enrolled here. It's supposed to be a project that you give your ALL to. Y'know, make it the best thing that You've Ever Made, that sort of thing. It's a graduation requirement that we have to try out every artform the school provides or us here since, y'know, it's an art school. For us juniors, it's basically a practice project that prepares us to do the actual thing in our senior year. That doesn't mean we don't have to try our best on this project however. I bet you guys can guess what I'm doing for my project. If you can't, then just wait until March 4th comes around... or read two entries above. Depends if you're lazy or not. I wanted to write a bit more, but I'm out o' time!!! Maybe next month...

Well, it was the day! Yesterday officially marks 4 years I've been doing this thing. I was originally supposed to post this yesterday but I Forgot. whoops... Wow! I've wasted 4 years of my life writing to a Long Ass Webpage that nobody reads! Haha, just kidding! I'm very popular. You can trust me 100%! Now, regarding that thing I said I'd talk about today in my last entry. If you're not in the know, I'm currently planning to fully rework the hub site for this 'Junior Project' that I have to do. Well, it's something that's been in the works for a while now, I just haven't allocated the proper time to actually work on it until now. Y'know, getting distracted on other projects and such, along with fluctuating motivation. Now, I actually have a reason to start on it! I'm still quite early in the process but I do have some concepts on what I want the rework to look like. I've also been trying to experiment with the Canvas API, which'll be primarily used for the background of the site, but it's proven to be a little difficult. Probably due to my inexperience with Javascript if I had to guess... I haven't written any Javascript in a while so I've been trying to get refamiliarized with it. (is that even a word?) I have a very specific design for the background but trying to use vanilla Javascript has definitely shown some problems, so I may... sigh... use jQuery (or some other library) to help aid the process. I've been looking at a few since yesterday (this sentence and all that follow are written on the 5th) and two that notably caught my eye are EaselJS and FabricJS. I think if I do decide to go with a library then I'll probably use FabricJS (if I haven't found a better library by then) since EaselJS seems to be more primarily used for web games. Well, I would write more but I have some school things to work on (that aren't the rework) sooo Idk I might write more later but Probably Not!

It's time for another entry...! Small thing I've been thinking about. Is the correct way to emphasize punctuation at the end of your sentence '...!' or '..!'? I typically do the former but I've seen a few other people do the latter, so I don't really know which is correct or not. If I had to guess, maybe people do the latter because they count the dot in the exclamation mark as the third... ellipse? Ellipsi? Whatever the word is. Maybe it's all up to preference...! Maybe..! Hopefully that got my brain ready to write, because I Am Prepared. To. Write. A lot. Hopefully! If I can think of things to talk about. Yup! Totally not stalling! Anyway, yesterday I finally finished drivers education. Well, the class part of it. I still need to do my drives, (along with 50 cumulative hours driving by myself, 10 of those at night) but I no longer have to spend 2 hours after school learning about... well, i don't know, intersections? traffic signs? Things like that. Fun fact! Did you know the most dangerous places to be while driving are intersections? I didn't! I, like others, thought that freeways/highways were the most dangerous. However, looking back on what we learned, I can definitely see how intersections take that spot. What even are the differences betweens freeways and highways? Maybe I should've asked my instructor this before I finished the class... Well, good thing we got The Google!! Apparently, freeways are essentially highways where access to the roadway is controlled. Basically, you can only enter a freeway by on/off-ramps and traffic travelling in opposite directions are usually separated by a median. (a median is a barrier between the two different directions of traffic, think of those concrete barriers you see in the middle of freeways!) They also have higher speed limits than a highway and are typically in more urban areas. Well, that answers one part! So, what are highways then? Or more specifically, what are highways that aren't freeways? Well, they're essentially the opposite of what freeways are. No ramps, traffic signals and pedestrian crossings, and lower speed limits. So, aren't highways just normal roads then? From what I'm reading, yeah basically. Credit to ADOT and Britannica for the information. Callback to the first entry there... Also, just a random fact about me, I don't actually live in a shed. I humbly apologize for the possiblity of that information shattering your hopes and dreams. Hi, it's the Next Day now. I didn't have a lot of time yesterday to write as it was an A-day schedule which requires me to be actually focused. WHAT!!! Yeah, I know, me being focused?! That's CRAZY TALK. Anyway, I hopefully have more time to write today so I can increase that character count more. I've been slacking lately but I assure you... I won't slack no more! Until I have to actually get working on things that is. I should probably be working on things right now actually... but naaaah they can wait. I went to the dentist today to get my teeth cleaned and to get an xray of them too. Good news! No cavities! I was a little surprised as my back tooth on the left side of my mouth has been hurting a little. Or at the very least feeling... weird I guess. But they said I had no cavities so they're probably just really sensitive. They also said that I should brush those back teeth better as there was a lot of buildup, so that may also be the reason. It's a little difficult to properly brush back there as... well I don't know. It's just difficult, okay!?! Jeez... One part that I really don't like about the dentist is the process they do when they take an xray of your teeth. I don't know if it's different at other dentist offices, but where I go they have this plastic thing that they put in your mouth that you have to bite down on. Problem is, I gag almost every time they try to get an xray of my back teeth. This time they had to get two people to get the xray for my back teeth. One to put the plastic thing in my mouth, another to press the button to take the xray. At least I only have to do it once per year... Progress on the LTE hub rework is going good I guess? I haven't gotten much work on the actual code, but I've had a few ideas circulating in my head. I've also decided to use Fabric.js as the library of my choice as it has quite a few features that I could find useful for the site, along with their examples being easy to follow. I haven't experimented with it yet, but I plan to! Soon! Maybe! Depends if I can allocate the time without getting distracted... now that I think of it... isn't writing to this LTE a distraction? I don't really know how to proceed with this entry realizing that. Moving on... apparently Pickler is making some sort of Secret Society named the White Raven Society. oooOOOOOoooo... spooky... I think. I don't know if she's going for that kind of vibe, but I looked over the site and I Like It! I looked over the source code purely for curiosity and there's a lot of crazy CSS stuff going on there! I don't even know what some of it is... the hell is a 'nth-child' or a 'clip-path'??? You can probably guess how inexperienced I am with CSS. I haven't experimented much with it as it's a little confusing to me. I still have to look up the difference between the various CSS position values from time to time... Okay I kind of got distracted and I was looking up random things on Google and I possibly found something that could possibly negate the need to use Fabric.js for the background, maybe even the whole site. I don't know, I'll still have to experiment with it, but it uses a few CSS tricks to get the background I want for the site, most notably the 'linear-gradient' CSS property. I think I'll leave this entry here as I've written a lot and I also want to experiment with a few things for the rework. Try to catch up to me NOW, PICKLER!!! HAHAHA!!!

Hey, sure has been a while hasn't it! Sorry, just with Neocities being blocked on school computers among other priorities, it's been a little difficult to find time to write for this. Fortunately, at 2:09 AM on July 13th, 2024, I've decided to dedicate some of my time to write a new entry! So, one of the biggest things one might wonder is, "Where the hell's the rework!?" Like I've stated before, Neocities got blocked on our school computers so that kind of ruined my plans to actually put in some work for that. I kind of had to compromise for the school project that was associated with that rework by making a more-so elevated concept than my initial drafts. It wasn't much, nor did it have a lot according to what I had planned, but I didn't really have a lot of time to do much considering that all the time I had during classes I couldn't even use to work on the project. Really convienient that Neocities got blocked as soon as I started to work on the project. so fun... Anyway, I'm currently planning to actually put my plans into effect next year regarding my Senior Project, but we'll see how that goes. Anyway, moving forward with how I'll handle this LTE now that I can't work on it at school... well... I don't know really. Currently, I just plan to write for it when I feel like it as opposed to forcing myself to write during my spare time. However, times between entries can be... inconsistent to say the least. Could be a few days to a few months between entries, really just depends on how motivated I feel. My motivation varies A LOT, so big emphasis on the 'inconsistent'. Anyway, I've reversed the profanity filter being forced so now you can view the LTE in it's full, uncensored glory! The reason why I forced the filter in the first place was due to my LTE being a large part of an academical piece, more specifically a whole 13+ page essay I did to support my Junior Project I did last year. (which was supposed to be the rework but, y'know) Anyway, I've been up to a variety of things lately, from playing games to... making them? Well, not really, but I have been experimenting with modding a few which has helped me learn a little about some other programming languages along with more general experience. Maybe I'll share a few on my personal page... when the time is right. I know that doesn't make much sense right now, but if you knew the position that I'm in right now, I think you'd understand... maybe. In regards to playing games, I've been getting back into Minecraft recently. And for the first time in my life, I actually beat the game FULLY Legitimately! ...I know that isn't that much of a flex, but still! It happened! And I gotta talk about it! Or else this entry won't be entertaining! I would share a picture of my house that I built on the world, but I don't really feel like it right now as it's pretty late... and I'm also like 2,000 blocks away from my house in the stronghold BUT!!! I think it's a pretty neat house. I also built a nifty basement too, which isn't fully finished but I'm liking it so far! Topic change, there's been a lot of ants in my house recently so my mother put down some ant traps around the house. They seem to be working pretty well so far, hopefully they don't Come BACK!!! GRAAAAH!!!! GET OUT!!!!!! I keep finding ants all over my SHIT!!! Not my literal SHIT!!! But my TREASURE!!! Because I'm a PIRATE!!! ARRRR!!!!!! cough cough AAAnyway, it's recently come to my attention that One Little Person has made a new LTE! Apparently instead of writing, they've developed a Markov chain model which was trained on a 100 MB text file filled with YouTube math videos, shitpost captions, and some LTEs. Essentially, it was generated using an AI model. Looking at it, I can definitely see that Pickler's and I's LTEs were used to trained the model, which I'm not fully sure how to feel about. I mean, as long as they're not using it for monetary gain I guess it's fine? Well, I've used ChatGPT to generate code before that is used for this LTE so I'm not really in a place to talk. Course, this LTE will be classified as an untrue LTE, but I'll still be documenting it on the LTE website. I currently don't have a place to put untrue LTEs on the site (which was planned for the rework), so I'm not adding it just yet but I'll make a note to add it later. Here's the LTE if you're interested in checking it out in the time being, it's a very interesting read. Apparently Knockton has finally released their remake of their LTE, sick!! Aaand... pickle has passed me in character count. i have a little message to you, pickler. soon, i shall take back my throne of being number two on the lte site and you will utterly weep at my pureform superiority in the art that is 'lte-ing'. SOON. But I'm tired, so I'll let you live for now. Speaking of, I think I'll end this here. Who knows, maybe I'll update this tomorrow, or in 20 years... sometime in between at least. Good night everyone!

okay as of just a few minutes of posting that previous entry, it seems that i am just about 600 characters ahead of picker's lte. so please disregard the message i packaged within that entry towards pickler. however, if between this entry and the next pickler happens to surpass me once more then please do regard that message. -Thanks, Mckenzie (howds)

Day 1

This is the first sentence. BOOOOOM!!! It's done… I'm already at the fourth sentence. You know what? I'm more professional than other LTE’ers! is that how you say it. I don't know. Anyway.. I'm more professional.. So I'm creating a word quota.. I don't know what it is but trust me (actually dont) it exists. My computer is at 2% and is telling me I have 11 minutes left… so i'm going to use that to write here. I use the .. or the … thing too much so that I can't get criticized for improper punctuation… even if I didn't use it I would not be criticized because nobody is actually taking the time out of their day to read this… I’m currently sitting in an art room writing… What I am currently doing is breaking the laws of physics… It's great!! Oh no the physics police are after me now. Gotta run!! Just kidding there is no such thing as the physics police. Now that I have written all of this.. I felt like in the first few sentences it was going so fast... but now that i'm getting less random its taking more time to write… the patron saint of paperclips is the best human alive!! I sent an email telling her so. hers might not be the longest but is by far the most interesting. Since one of my friends discovered the website: he got me and a few others into reading it, and now i'm entering the world of LTE-ing with this!!! I suck at grammar so give me a break… please! I'm begging you!!?! I love using a question mark and exclamation point like this: chicken!!!?! Because it achieves an initially confident effect, but then it devolves into someone kinda questioning their own sanity a bit… It's so great!!!! My computer is now telling me that it's still at 2% but it only has 8 minutes left… this is the beginning of the end!!!!?! Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees! My computer is auto correcting that long yes to Yeh Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Which I think is really weird… I don't know why that is happening. It's very strange… I don't know why life is happening. It's very strange… bye! I'm back now. Just kidding! I don't exist! I'm listening to music to pick a track for a theatre piece we are doing in class… YES, I'm a theatre kid! dont judge me. We got to make submissions for songs we could listen to for the piece and I submitted megalovania. Someone the mii creator music, and the five minute crafts intro. It was great! Time to be more random. Lolcat is the best minecraft language setting. I play a lot of minecraft… like a lot of minecraft... too much minecraft... “do not pass your judgement unto me!” (in posh british accent)... that's how you say don't judge me all fancy and stuff. Cheese is the best thing since cheese! (and sliced bread, and me, and you, and life itself, and cheese, and gold, and trench coats, and demons, and yes!) Why is cheese! What is cheese! How is cheese! The real question is WHEN is cheese!! Cheese is not a wild thing!! So stop putting it in zoos, and in people's computers! stupid monkeys!! Monkeys like monkey cheese!! Cheese made out of monkeys! monkeys made out of cheese! Woooooo!! Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese!!! Long cheese! Short cheese!! Long paragraph!!! Short paragraph!! Cheese is watching!! Spaghetti! I don't really like spaghetti. I don't know why though, I don't hate it. I just don't like it for some reason. maybe it's the texture, maybe the taste, maybe something else, DONT hate on me for not really liking spaghetti!! Please!! I beg you!!!?! I'm not actually begging you though!! Bye!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm back now 7 minutes left on my battery somehow. I'm pretty sure my computer is lying to me… I've used this computer for like an hour… I'm gonna start numbering the days that I'm writing this… because that's cool!! The exclamation point at the end of this sentence marks around 4000 characters! Now you know! Not that you want to know.. or really know at all unless you check... maybe I'm lying! dun dun dun!! actually i'm not lying! dun dun dun!! that's why I said maybe I am lying instead of being certain that I am lying because I am in fact not lying! But that probably doesn't make sense anyway!! Over 4100 characters… but you won't know unless you check... so maybe i'm lying dun dun dun or maybe not dun dun dun so that's why I said maybe and all that and stuff... and i'm gonna stop being a broken record! But it's fun… but its not… but it's fun… but its not… but it's fun… but it's not… but it's fun… but it's not… but its fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Is holding down the button to make lots of that character breaking the rules of LTE-ing? Hopefully not… I mean it's not copy and paste… what are the rules anyway? Are there rules? I'm gonna stop talking/typing and leave now!!

Day 2

(in a sad tired voice) Whats up guys and welcome back to episode 1983678549 of my minecraft lets play… today we will keep trying to find herobrine… by breaking bedrock with a wooden pickaxe… I am sad… my life is a lie… the cake is a lie… this lets play is a lie… (2 hours of bedrock mining later) aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Okay that's it for today! comment like and subscribe!! See you all next time!!! (outro plays) Happy over 5000 character anniversary by the way! At this rate I will have an LTE long enough to be one in no time! Does an LTE have to have a length? Is it 20000 words? 10000? Is there a set length? Is what I have right now an LTE? Will I be recognized if I post this? Even if I get 100000 words I probably won't get recognized… I am sad now. That is a depressing statement! or is it! Was that great or was it GREAT!! It was awesome! That changed your life! probably not! Yay!! What is the point of an LTE? Is there a point? Is it fame? (spoiler: nope) is LTE-ing actually the meaning of life!!?! My name is Uiefuhgrvun9orip, not bob! Not that you thought it was bob in the first place!?! I just choked on an airhead trying to steal someone's computer... now I am constantly tasting airhead! Life is pain!! Just kidding, life is cheese!! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! grapes! Recently I have been saying grapes instead of great. I don't know why, but I just do! People get really confused but I DO NOT CARE!! By the way... we are at over 6000 Characters!! Not that you really care!! I doubt anyone but me is reading this right now. Why are half of the characters here just me talking/typing about talking, or typing! or the amount of characters I'm at!! or me talking/typing about me talking/typing about me talking/typing... (pretend this goes forever) Why am I even making paragraphs… it probably would look longer without them.. I wish I could change it but a lot of the stuff I have written revolves around the paragraphs existing… soooo… no deleting the paragraph breaks… who am I even talking to!!?! You know what!?! I'm deleting all of the paragraph breaks!!!! Except the day ones! We are now almost up to 7000 characters. That's grapes! We are currently at 6904 characters! Why did I feel you needed to know that… I HAVE NO IDEA!!!!!! This sentence will hopefully pass 7000! Yay it did that's grapes!! I don't know what to write next! That's bad!! Like extremely bad!!! Because that's literally the point of this whole thing!! writing!!! And I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO WRITE!!!!!! I just successfully summoned the physics police upon me by breaking newtons 32nd law “Thou shalt write about not writing!”. of course Newtons 32nd law does not exist! but nobody cares!!! I need to actually make a word quota... I think I said on day 1 that it existed. but I don't know what it is! today I am going to find out!! I think I might make it 3000 characters. I'm probably not gonna do that. I'm not doing this on the weekends (unless I get really bored)... if I do this for 2 weeks… 3000 characters a day... five days a week... I will make it to around 38000 characters which is more than some other LTE’s! Which is awesome!! it's nowhere near flaming chickens.. but it's something! Hey three pages in google docs!! There are lots of characters already!! Do you know how many!! 8000 characters!! Grapes!! Most of this LTE is me talking about how many characters i'm at.. and when i'm done with that I write like a couple of random sentences then do it again!!! 8177 Characters!! now 8200 characters!! Bye!! Just kidding! I don't exist!! I've said that twice now! That's grapes!! I almost never use commas in this, or periods, I almost always punctuate my sentences with an exclamation point or a “...”, or maybe even a “..”!!! This LTE is pretty random! I am in a car that is currently parked outside of a “papa murphys” that is situated next to a “cricket”! Does a “cricket” store sell crickets! I put the quotation marks on the names of the store’s so that you didn't get confused as to why the papa murphys was situated next to a random insect.. not that you would have gotten confused... but you might have! then again, this whole thing is kinda confusing!! But that's also kinda the point of LTE’s.. is to be very entertaining.. and boring at the same time! If you are currently reading this… I don't know who you are, but you are thoroughly wasting your time!!

Day 5

I did not write on monday/yesterday because we did not have school, and I wasn't bored enough to write. I believe the Oxford comma should be used, because if you don't use it, there can be lots of confusion. “The oxford comma can sometimes create more confusion though”, some might say. but it still answers more questions than it creates, and therefore should be used in modern writing. It is a necessary step towards a less confusing future! (plus it will be our chief defence against the squid uprising of 2021).. Is there a point to this.. Life I mean.. NOPE! And I couldn't care less about it!! What is the definition of the word definition.. if you don't know what definition means then you can’t get the definition of definition!! That's weird! You know how when you stand on your hands it's called a handstand.. Well if you stand on your feet is it a footstand… I want an official flaming chickens handbook! The patron saint of paper clips said that it would come in the mail.. but it never did… it kinda makes you wonder if the official flaming chickens handbook really even exists.. I question my own sanity!! I hate that I have to say this but.. I have not yet read the entirety of the flaming chickens LTE! I am sad about this fact. but do you know what will cheer me up! that I am currently half way to creating an LTE longer than another respected LTE so (probably not) I might get recognized as a respected LTE-er!! (I’m currently over 10500 characters)!! My school day is almost over. I have 5 minutes left on my computer. and I am nowhere near my word quota!! But I’m too lazy to do anything about it. so I’m gonna just pretend I hit my quota and forget about it!! I had a really bad 3rd grade teacher. My friend was literally diagnosed with PTSD because of my third grade teacher! I accidentally said “I love you” to some random person I barely know.. They walked away before I could say that I didn't mean to say that, so I just made someone think that I had an attraction to them even though I really don't.. OOPS! I don't know if they are gonna spread that rumor, but that's gonna be awkward next time I see them. Hopefully that doesn't turn into some kind of drama or something! Hopefully they thought I said something else, or didn't hear me, hopefully they don't have feelings for me that i'm about to crush!! Bold text! Italic text! Underlined text! Everything at the same time!! Alright I’m done!! We did an empathy exercise and I got a funny story.. and my partner got a serious one, and it was awkward!! seeya!!

Day 6

This is the fourth page in google docs. I don't know why I felt you needed to know this.. This is likely not even in google docs if you are reading it.. That thing on the oxford comma earlier was a thing for school I wrote in here.. then copy and pasted it into another doc to turn it in.. but I almost accidentally turned this in.. that would not have ended well!! Here is a fun fact. Just last week I learned to blow bubbles with bubblegum, I mean it has “bubble” in the name and yet I still haven't blown a bubble with it until a week ago! That scares me! I have yet to read through this text yet to see the downward spiral of my own sanity as our great overlord the patron saint of paperclips has! I am a failure! Do you know how I write this? no you don't? I write a bunch of stuff without punctuation because it's quicker then go back through and fix spelling errors, and add dots, and commas, and exclamation points, and question marks, etc! so right now a whole half of this day is just a jumble of words which will then be turned into a punctuated jumble of words!! neat!!! But not really though!! It's actually very lazy!! Despite what I might have thought, I actually almost hit my word quota for the day yesterday! That's great! I'm not even halfway to doing it today though. but I’m at lunch which is only like a quarter of the way through the day so hopefully I will have plenty of time! What am I gonna do during the summer since I don't have school? will I still be able to write? are they going to take my computer (this is a school issued computer)? If I was on a video call with you and I claimed I was holding an invisible dog? you wouldn't be able to prove me wrong! That would be awesome!! I was going to hang out with my friends today at lunch but instead I’m sitting in a corner in a hallway doing this.. just so you know I am older than 10 at the time of writing this.. I am in middle school.. I don't want to give away personal information (I don't know why because nobody is actually reading this) but I'm not really a kid.. You know what? I’m creating an official pink-ish pickle handbook!! The cult of the pink-ish pickle is the best thing to ever not really exist!! CODE 24 of the pink-ish pickle handbook clearly states: if you will not believe that the cult of the pink-ish pickle does not exist then you shall be punished severely (unless you are a dog)! Speaking of.. Dogs are the best thing to happen ever since the dawn of time and even before that! If there is a before that.. I already forgot what I wrote about like 10 lines ago because I am just going with the flow of this text (if there really is a flow)! I am about 300 characters away from my daily quota plus I am already almost at 15500 Characters! I just re-read my LTE so far! And I can say you can definitely see that I have slowly gotten more insane as this has gone on!! This is not GRAPES for my mental health… but i'm going to keep going because i'm already so insane that I'm going to keep going.. and going.. and going.. and going.. and.. going see i'm ever repeat.. repeat...repeating.. Myself! have you ever written (or said) a single word so many times that it looks (or sounds) like it's not ever a real word anymore.. because I just did that! Yay!! That's GRAPES!!! Yay! I made my word quota for the day!! And I got to over 15044 characters!! As CODE 26 of the pink-ish pickle handbook states: if the author/leader of the pink-ish pickles passes 15000 characters the author shall be very proud of themselves and if you/the reader are not also proud of the author then you shall be subjected to vague pain-like sensations in your right pinky toe..

Day 7

I started this a week ago and it feels like yesterday! Honestly I feel like I’m still 7 soo.. That's not saying much.. I am almost at 5 pages!! I don't know why I bestowed that knowledge upon you!! But I did! How old is the patron saint of paperclips now? I am too lazy to go all game theory on the flaming chickens longest text ever to find the age, name, and current political standing of the patron saint of paperclips. Ok well im an idiot and decided to do exactly the opposite of what I just said! So I tried to find out the age, (full) name, and current political standing of the patron saint of paperclips.. Code 19 of the unofficial official pink-ish pickle handbook states that: if the author should steal ideas from the original flaming chickens LTE (i.e: making a fake handbook for a fake cult) they shall be punished severely via invisible pains in the hands because of overuse due to trying to write a really bad LTE!!! I just read on the news that a goose got high off of pills left in a forest… I got really depressed because humanity is doomed! but then immediately happy because of the fact that there was a picture of the high goose at the top of the article!! There is currently someone trying to comment on this doc.. They have also read the flaming chickens LTE and they are saying things about “meg” and stuff like that! Just thought you should know.. “My day is almost over and I have written like nothing today” I said sadly.. then I realized this doesn't matter anyway, so I DON'T CARE!!!! Nobody besides me and my friend will probably even know that this exists!! Time for me to go on a rant! I have F’s and D’s in most of my classes (it's the beginning of second semester) because my teachers won't grade my dang assignments!! Some (mostly other teachers, and parents who don't understand) say “teachers are people too, and grading takes time out of their day” well I say “kids are people too, and doing the dang assignments takes time out of our day!! Plus all they have to do is check if we are right or wrong!! but we have to do things by ourselves!! Without a dumb answer book!!” I’m better at maths then my maths teacher is! “Those who cannot do: teach” is VERY true!!!!!! Ok I’m done.. I have 15 minutes left until the end of the day!! Then I’m going to go home and learn how to play “Sweden” by C418 on the piano.. even though I’m a noob at piano.. but you gotta learn sometime.. so screw it!! Ok bye!!

Day 8

It has now been more than a week since I started this weird project!! Woo! I have now caused myself mental pain for 8 days straight!! My friend.. (the one that I talked about earlier with the goose stuff..) he is now making a website called the shrine of the goose.. It is devoted solely to weird random stuff (its sorta like flaming chickens but focused on geese).. I am sitting down right now! Speaking of.. What qualifies as lying down vs sitting?? That's a strange question.. with a probably equally strange answer.. but I’m too lazy to find out… my friend is once again reeking havoc in the comments on this doc.. SHUT IT!! That was him… YOU DUMB NERD!!! That was him again.. I don't know why I’m accepting his suggestions… I really am a dumb nerd!! Lol!!! Again im at the end of the day and still have got (almost) nothing written

Day 11

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Sanity quickly draining!!! Just kidding! I don't exist!! I Have recently appointed myself patron saint of weirdly coloured pickles!! Isn't that great!! Ow! my hands have suddenly begun to hurt!! In compliance with CODE 19 of the pink-ish pickle handbook!! My school day is almost over again again and I have written basically nothing!! Not that I actually have to write anything.. This is my choice.. I could abandon this now and never do it again and nobody.. not even me.. would care.. And yet.. I still put pressure on myself regarding writing a specific amount per day!! WHY!!!

Day 12

Okay, I have a rant.. WHY DO GUMMY WORMS EXIST!!! Why would a reasonable human want to eat a gummy (which tastes the exact same might i add) that is shaped like a worm, which is inedible! vs eat a gummy shaped like a fruit, that is edible!! Why!! Why are people stupid enough to want to eat a worm rather than a fruit!!! what is this teaching kids!! to eat worms!? That's like saying “do you want to eat something shaped like poison or an apple” and then everyone picks the poison!! Why do people like gummy worms!!! I am still wondering why probably most of this at this point is me writing about writing? Speaking of… only another (about) 1000 characters until my LTE is longer than another LTE that is recognized!! Yay!! In fact I already have more words but soon I will also have more characters!! Shout outs to Kenneth Iman’s LTE!!! My friend is working on a website that is kind of an LTE hub.. he is going to find most of the LTE’s ever created and put them on one website! which as far as I know has never been done before!! Shout outs to Mckenzie (a.k.a the person in the comments and also the person that makes the weird websites)!! The last three days put together doesn't even hit my word quota for one day… but nobody cares anyway so… why am I even doing this in the first place.. For fun maybe… probably… I haven't actually put this on a website yet… I haven't even started on a website that I might put this on yet… I'm gonna do that right now!! This is awesome!! This is a great website!! Wow!! Okay.. now what the heck do I do now.. I can't think of anything to write about! that sucks!! Sorry that this is a neocities site.. I am poor.. and therefore cannot afford my own domain.. But look on the bright side.. somehow you found this and are currently reading it!! Maybe you hate it! but I don't care… I don't know who you are.. Or what your name is... or if anyone is actually reading this!! But if you are reading this… Thank you! for wasting time in your life that you will never get back!! On this pile of garbage!!! Hopefully watching me go quickly insane, (over the span of 12 days now) in writing form has made you at least somewhat more happy! or sad.. this text is actually a mind control device!!! Mwahahaha!!! Just kidding!! I don't exist!! I have 1% left on my computer, and it's about to die! so i'm going to write until it does.. because im stupid! It died.. so i put it on the charger.. Like a smart person.. Even though I am very un-smart! But I had to use it for an assignment in one of my classes.. so I decided to actually be responsible for once!! Cool!

Day 13

too un-bored to write!! wooooooooo!! That's grapes!

day 14

This is my last class of the day and then I'm going home.. And I'm only starting to write... But the good news is yesterday my friend from my elementry school got into my current school! And yesterday was his first day! We had lunch together.. Had a reunion thing.. That was fun! I dont know why I'm talking about serious things you and I might actually care about! Thats not what you want right!?! You want insanity! Why do potatoes grow in the ground.. They are not very well hidden.. They have a thing that goes above ground to get sun.. Why not just stay below ground and get nutrients from the dirt!? Evolution is stupid a lot of the time! It created humans.. Which are currently destroying the planet!! *maniacle laugh* Oops!

day 15

Hello fellow humans! (unless you are not human)!! My friend (not mckenzie) showed me a news report that said "{insert name here} was alive hours before he died!"! that was really funny!!

day 18

I was lazy so I took a break because as I have mentioned: I dont actually have to do this! i'm doing this because I want too!! anyways I decided to do this because my friend (Mckenzie) is making an LTE.. so yay! this is the link! also today is march 6th 2020 im saying this mostly for myself, so when I abandon this and find it again and write a new entry.. then I can know what day to write!

day 323

Hello, I am alive. it has been almost a year, ummmmmm... nobody cares? ok. it is January 5th 2021. Also, my punctuation has gotten better, I don't use as many "..."'s now.. DANG IT! Ummmm.. Mckenzie, if you are reading this (which I will make sure you do), update ur LTE again, or else! or else what?!?!?! I DONT KNOW!!!! I am doing online school now, I am currently in a zoom called "Science class". I am supposed to be listening to what my teacher is talking about, but I am not. is that illegal? Porbably not. I am stressed that my dad will walk in suddenly and discover that I am not paying attention, probably. See you when I am bored enough to do this again!!!!?!!

day 329

Greetings peculiar pickle people, i am very tired! So, I am writing today. i dont know what im writing about, pretty much buisness as usual. i am going crazy. anyways, another one of friends is making an LTE. after all of these years, he has finally discovered the magic of LTE's! And both me and mckenzie are coming out of LTE retirement! So both of their LTE's are now linked at the bottom of the page, along with the original flaming chickens LTE. I might make a youtube video about the rather unknown LTE community, maybe not. just kidding! i dont exist!! (its been a while since ive done that.. it feels good to be back..) and always reeeeemeber, life is short, I could abandon this any second and go do something with my life. regardless, have a noice day! Just kidding! im back! oh, and i dont exist! Ok, so you probably arent wondering why I stopped saying how many words I am at. and why my spelling, grammer, punctuation, and stuff like that has gotten worse. Well, its because when I started this LTE, I didnt want to have a website with only a little bit of text, i wanted to have something so it wasnt so empty. so I started the LTE of a google doc, which has word count and spell check. then I made it into a website. and now, instead of writing in the doc. im writing straight into the html console, so i can see all the code and stuff. thats also why sometimes there are things wear I would change the font and stuff, or use italic text. but that didnt carry over into the html console, and im too lazy to remove it. so it is going to stay, i wonder if people actually check this often, i have around 230 hits, but some are prolly me and/or mckenzie, so. and if i had people who actually followed this frequently, they probably stoopped checking after I left for a year. So even less people will actually see these words, sad.. but not really, this is kinda crazy and I dont tell many people about it because even if I did, then they would probably stop talking to me, the only people ive really showed this to are mckenzie and busterddog, nobody else really kno- my dad just almost walked in on me typing in this. that wouldve been bad, if my dad ever sees this. im sorry. also, mckenzie just send me an email that his touchpad (on his school computer) broke, which sucks for him. My sense of humor hasnt changed much since last year, so using the old jokes from this LTE isnt that hard. except for the part where I made a handbook thing and appointed myself patron saint of something, that was kinda blatant plagarism. but who cares, I certainly dont. I think day one was actually the day I wrote the most, is was a lot more random. but it was a lot bigger, maybe I should return to my LTE roots, maybe??? i have no idea! also, this is my longest entry since the gummy worms rant, yay! Ok, Cya when I get bored again!!

day 330

Hey, I'm back. Today is a special day, well it was actually yesterday. but nobody cares. so, BusterDdog did his first rant! I know.. "only one rant!".. but he has to start somewhere, baby steps.. maybe someday he will have an LTE to rival mine.. probably not though, he hasnt even stolen anything from the flaming chickens LTE yet.. btw his rant was about school, online school.. which sucks. i got a lot of sleep last night but i am still really tired, i dont know why.. I might start working on the script for the LTE video, but i have a lot of other scripts in the wprks right now. including some for school, so maybe not yet. i will let you know.. anyways, i am tired. seeya laters!

day 331

So, ummmm... BusterDdog made a speech, on his LTE.. idk if you count that as a rant or what.. but he is rallying people to say syrup instead of seeya.. so, do that.. i need to go do real life stuff, so.. seey- i mean, syrup!

day 363

Greetings gozarians (yes, that was a ghostbusters refrence..), im back.. the day after tommorow is the 1 year anniversary of the start of this LTE.. i might do something on that day, maybe not though.. Also, i updated the look of the site to make it look nicer.. all of the day parts are bigger, the mage at the top is smaller, there is a title at the top.. its cool! Anyways, BusterDdog updated his LTE.. so, go check that out with the link and the bottom of the site.. also, i have some top-secret info about his name: its not buster, nor does he have a dog named buster.. idk where that name came from.. Maybe he can update his LTE and tell me *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*.. alrighty im just gonna say it, HEY EVERYBODY, UPDATE UR LTES! do you know what i just realized? no? ok.. so i just realized i am the only person in our little LTE group that constantly yells at everyone to update their LTEs.. but then i take long breaks and dont update mine.. weird.. alrighty, syrup!

day 364

Hi,i have returned with exciting news! (idk if that is spelled correctly)! I have figured out a way (i think) to send everyone notifications that the LTE has been updated! I think that if you join a google docs, as the owner i can email everyone simultainously, and, since it is a google docs it also doubles as a chatroom! I know, i have the most amazing ideas. anyways, im gonna go do that. i will update the website when im done.

day something

Hello, i am to lazy to figure out the day (its been at least 3 days since the last entry, but idk.). so, this is day something. i am making this to notify you i completely forgot about the docs thing, i might go work on that now. So, i that might be up within a reasonable timeframe. bye for now!

srsly tho what day is it

All hail the holy pie god! The being of three identities, please spare me from your holy punishment! (Please)

*shrug*

idk why im updating this, i have nothing to say.. i still need to figure out what day it is..soooo, thats fun.. Goldfish (the snack cracker not the real fish) are better than Cheez-Itz (also a snack cracker but idk what you would confuse that for).. fight me, goldfish are just better.. umm, go check out the LTE's at the bottom of the page. two of them are my friends, and then the flaming chickens LTE.. which is prolly the best one.. other than mine of course *cool sunglasses emoji*..

This day is just the chrome dino game

DINO GAME

why was yesterday the chrome dino game?!?!

i have no idea..

Another day

Ok, hey guys.. im still not gonna figure out what day it is, but.. i finally did the chatroom thingy! idk why i didnt do it for so long.. but, if anyone wishes to like, chat with me on google docs.. or recieve LTE update emails, then join this google doc..

I still havent figured out the day again idk plz halp

hi, im back. just kidding, i dont exist!! Anyways, i killed the chatroom and update thing... i dont think anyone visits this site. idk what im doing here.. Mckenzie updated his LTE.. check it out with one of the links at the bottom of the page. He also has a new LTE hub, which you can access today for the low low price of clicking the link to it thats on his website!! My science class sucks cause its very boring, i have a teacher named Mr. Joy (YES THATS ACTUALLY HIS NAME). Ironically, he spreads boredom, which is the oppsite of joy.

I wonder what the day is?

So, im in a boring school meeting thing. It is way too formal, and im not sure its even legally binding or whatever, we're approving budgets and plans for the various clubs and things in the school.. and im not our groups representative, or the alternate, so im just here, typing. I think the people sitting next to me are wondering what im doing, i should prolly not be doing this. Anyways, yesterday i went to a rock climbing thing. It was more of a knot tying thing, we did very little climbing, but we learned to operate the belays and tie the knots. I learned a knot that allows me to make a noose. So i guess i have that skill now, and this boring meeting is making me want to use that skill. Also also, Mckenzies LTE is being updated semi-frequently, so go check that out. He made a new better LTE HUB, which is cool. I like cheese, idk.. random stuff.. uhhhhhh.. Goodbye, just kidding, i dont exist. (Do i exist?)

DAY 582

GUYS, I FIGURED OUT THE DAY, BY GOOGLING "How many days has it been since march 4th, 2020?" (for those of you who dont know, first, why are you here? Second, thats the day i started the LTE.) I'm in the boring school meeting again, exactly one week after the last meeting. So, i was thinking about several things. At what point does something become cooked? Like, if put something in the oven, and watch it, at what point is it cooked and not raw? Also, what is the difference between bacon, pork, and ham? They are litterally all just sliced pig meat, what are the qualifying traits of bacon vs ham or pork? Also, its the time of year where it gets very cold very quick. A week ago it was mid 80's, and now its like 40's. Big drop in temperature. I ate lunch outside (this meeting takes place right after lunch), and it was SO cold. However, despite the unfavourable temperature, i made no effort to stay warm. So, now my hands are numb, and its very hard to type this. On top of all that, this meeting is in like the coldest place in the whole school. Okay, bye! just kidding, i dont exist! (ALSO, GO CHECK OUT MCKENZIE'S LTE, LINK AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS SITE!!)

DAY Something, crap i lost count again. Whiletrue LTE info!

REGARDING THE STATE OF THE WHILETRUE LTE! So, mckenzie recently checked the whiletrue LTE. And it was deleted and replaced with a message in a language google translate cannot.. translate. I know what language it is! it is written in a conlang called votgil (a conlang is a constructed language, bessically its a language somebody made up). So, Here is the link to votgil. (the website can translate the message!). And here is a link to the LTE HUB. And here is a link to the whiletrue LTE (or rather the message). SO, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO!! THE MESSAGE SAYSS (BTW this is a very rough literal translation):

"hello all you see most (loq) write receiver at this time i write the write receiver by anti english you probable total not understand this but (wot) that be okay you not need (wot) understand i crazy write gerund but (wot) if (wot) you understand also that be good that even be very good if (wot) you can (wot) say by anti english i want (wot) know you except if (wot) you be anti good person or some thing but (wot) i probable already know all which person know anti english anti english be which not lot person plural know language most person plural suppose (wot) anti english only be that one funny language of that video of (yön) (mys) (uly) and (wot) this person plural suppose (wot) anti english be anti good because only (wot) (yön) (mys) (uly) was say (wot) anti english be anti good i not enjoy this (yön) (mys) (uly) say lot anti correct thing plural in that video the video be very anti new the video was make passive during ranked six one zero two year (yön) (mys) (uly) even was say i suggest (wot) you not see focus any which i make video before ranked eight one zero two year for that logic (mys) (uly) probable also know (wot) that video about anti english be anti good but (wot) i say about this concept during too long time i probable should anti begin i should write about which other thing more interest in this very long write receiver but (wot) i not can (wot) good write about any thing this be anti good i could will begin (wot) know good concept for write gerund (wot) anti before some time i will anti begin i write gerund at this time but (wot) i could begin the write gerund at other time anti hello"

More Whiletrue translation!!

So, i am going to attempt to better translate the message above. (Jan Misali is a youtuber that reviews conlangs) (mostly fully translated)

hello all! You see most LTE's now are written in english. But i write my LTE in Votgil. Most of you probably dont understand this. But thats okay. You dont need to understand my crazy writings. But if you understand that would be good. That may even be very good. If you speak votgil, i want to get to know you. Except if you're a bad person or something. But i probably already know everyone that speaks votgil. Not a lot of people speak votgil. Most people probably only know votgil as that funny language from that video by Jan Misali, and they think votgil is bad, only because Jan Misali said that votgil is bad. i dont like that Jan Misali said a lot of wrong things in that video. The video is very old. The video was made during 2016. Jan Misali even said "i suggest you not pay attention to any video i've made before 2018." By that logic Misali probably knows that video about votgil is bad. But, ive talked about this for too long. i probably should stop. i should write about something more interesting in this LTE. But i cant write well about anything. Thats bad. i'll figure out something good to write about after some time. im gonna stop writing now. but i could start writing this at another time. Bye!

Day 639

SO, I discovered an LTE. I went on google using strange keywords to hunt for LTE's. AND I ACTUALLY FOUND ONE! So, thats good. Also, i'm at 37,426 charactersss!! coolio like julio, and when i say coolio like julio thats pretty coolio because julio is pretty coolio. Also, also, Mckenzie is doing cool stuff with his LTE, go check that out (link is at the bottom of the page)! Also, also, also, i was half asleep walking down a hallway in my house and i kicked a vacuum on accindent and like cracked my toenail in half, which is bad. Also, also, also, also, i'm gonna add the LTE HUB to the bottom of the page too! I am also killing the link to BusterDdog's LTE, cause i dont think hes updating it anymore! Death, dead. The death of the BusterDdog link has enabled the LTE HUB link to LIVE!! *mad science laughter* (also)

Day ?????????????????????

Friday night is goose night, not to be confused with game night, or cheesy queso. (=

Day No

Whyyyyy? Why can i not keep track of the dayyyyyy. Cheesey Quesooo? 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 8. Where did 7 go? Did it get arrested for eating 9?? Did it steal cheesy queso from the local bank? Why is 7 mysteriously abesnt?!?! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH

N I G H T

So, Mckenzie added darkmode so it would easier for my dumb eyes to read on these stupid chromebook thingys. D A R K

Afternoon not night or day, please let me know what day it is. Im stranded on an island with no calendars.

I like sour cream and onion chips. (:

Somewhere over the rainbow

Grapes and stuff. Cheese in bucket. NOOOO, modern mathematics is incomplete and broken! Somebody once told me, the world was gonna roll me. I'n not the sharpest tool in the airplane. So, you know how in music there is psychedelic rock, and in art there is modern or abstract art, which is like the psychedelic version of normal art. There is a psychedelic form of almost every form of art except writing. I think LTE's are just psychedelic writing. Pretty cool dolphin huh..

What is a day? I honestly forgor

G'mornin', Sooooo.. UHHHHHHHH. Talking. Stuff. LTE. I has returned. I has died. Bye. Just kidding, I dont exist! Also hey future me that is the only one looking at this, today is june 1st 2022, first day of pride monthhh! YEA. Anyway, I've been doing stuff for a bit. I started playing guitar a few months ago (I think more than 6 months), and I'm ALRIGHT at it now. I've always been interested in producing my own music, especially quirky simplistic acoustic music, so im doing that now occasinally. So, thats cool I guess. music boi. I've always liked writing lyrics and the i've liked that idea of performing music/learning an instrument so I could make that simple lyric focused acoustic music that I like. So.. Yeah. that i've Ummmmmmm.. Okay my class is ending I might talk and lte Later so byee for nowww!

I am now in my next class after that one and it is almost the end of class again but I dunno what to write. I just finished a multi-day maths test, I think I did alright (like a B+), and I'll take that. So, yeah I hope that went as well or better than i think it did. I might leave a link to some of my music here later, wait, actually nobody actually visits this site except me so I can just find the music in my files when I look back on this entry in the LTe. So, no music link for me! HAHA, future me! you're gonna have to look in your old files or youtube and find the music your fricken self! HAHAAHAHAHAHA. Also, I just realized I can put emojis in my LTE. 🎵

Wearing beige on a grey day

okay so, a lot has changed since I started this. My age (obviously), my gender, my opinion on string theory. Oh yeah, I'm a girl btw idk if I ever even suggested I was anything else throughout this LTE but just to clarify I am in fact girl. anyway, I've been writing much more music as of late, mostly guitar focused with lyrics but I've also done some more nerdy production and mixing stuff recently with drums and synths interwoven with different types of guitar; pretty cool I think. HMMMMMM.. I wonder if I've ever used a semicolon before in this, probably not. maybe that was a first for the penguin. The penguin is named archie, and they are very cool and nice, and also the physcial manifestation of this website; sorta like the weird pie thing mckenzie had going on a while back. btw it is currently nov 3rd of 2022 (saying this so I can date it later.. wait no, like find the date I don't want to be in a relationship with a penguin). anyways.. how is everyone doing? absolute silence WOW THATS GREAT TO HEAR!?!?@?! Anyway, I am like.. supposed to be doing stuff right now in literary arts (poetry and shiz) class, but i'm not, because this is more important (somehow). anyway, I think me and mckenzie may have gotten our friend harry into LTE-ing, which is GREAT (Until the fabric of the universe implodes). so that may be a thing soon, mckenzie has to help with it tho cos harry sucks at html. ALSO, mckenzie got sick today, and had to go home. loser. well i mean "got sick" is a bit misleading, to my knowledge he was already sick but just started to feel sick when arriving at class, so had to go home (like a loser). ANYWAY ANYWAY ANYWAY, that sickness is probably not related but quite possibly related to the fact that yesterday evening during d&d club (yes I'm a cool kid so therefore part of our schools d&d club after school (founded by harry)), and instead of focusing and playing d&d we snorted crystal light powder (the caffinated ones for extra kick), and lemme just say, that was a MISTAKE AND A HALF cos it actually effected us physically and mentally for the rest of club so we couldn't get anything doneee (except for killing some stupid goblins). also also recently I coudlmt remember the name of somebody i talk with so i was just like "your name is britney now" and so her name is britney now cos its easier to remember. so HI BRITNAY if you're reading this (you are not in fact reading this). anyway, goodhibegoodbyeinthefacewithacrappystrawberrymilkshake. also, no, I'm not currently cheeseburger, but I want one. OH NO THE BOLD IS LEAKING BUT IDK FROM WHERE AHHH. i just closed the bold here so its gone for the remainder (if any) of the LTE, weird. anyway crysis cant run on my computer and was also averted good job me hahahahahahaha. go away. also yes this entry was canon to the rest of the LTE if you were wondering, only one entry isn't canon but I'll never tell you which one it is.

nov 8 night 8 of fnaf (technically speaking)

anyway, its 12;15 AM and I'm thinking about the heat death of the universe. also, I found these people called the YESTERWEB and they like are reviving the old internet style and philosophy ya know? and I guess this website kinda fits into that category, but it's also very much probably not pretty enough to get accepted into their webring so I kinda regret applying. whatevs, good thing about old internet is if these people hate me i can leave forever or just die (by die I mean rejoin with a new username and hope nobody knows). anyway, that is to say. this may not be the "main" page for much longer, I may do a TOTAL renovation, wouldn't that just put some sweet and sour sauce on your chicken nuggets. I know it would. Anyway, good morning. (WHY IS GOOD MORNING AND GOOD EVENING (SOMETIMES) A GREETING BUT GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD AFTERNOON (SOMETIMES) ARE NOT LIKE WTF) Okay one more thing, mckenzies LTE is above 100,000 characters, so CONGRATS you ABSOLUTE NERD. Also, that LTE is SOO much bigger and updated so much more I have almost no hope of ever catching up now. back in my day, I had more characters but now his is almost TRIPLE mine. I KNOW YOU'RE TASTING THIS SENTENCE WITH YOUR EYEBALLS MCKENZIE AND I HOPE IT TASTES BAD, LIKE THAT STRAWBERRY COKE POWDER STUFF, YOU ARE A NERD AND A LOSER (not as big of a nerd or loser as harry but i don't think anything can top that anyway, HE EVEN WEARS GLASSES NOW (ignore the fact I also wear glasses))!! D:

ALSO I JUST REALIZED THERE IS A SNEAKY LEAK OF ITALIC FROM THE BOLD SPILL GODDAMNIT. I'LL FIX THAT HERE. OKAY im gonna attempt to cap the leak at the source but idk if it'll work cos of all the confusion I've done myself so lets find out. I've managed to fix it for the most part with only some permanent long term side damage. okay now bye bye

PSA

Do NOT listen to knockton (potato LTE on the hub (LTE HUB NOT ANY OTHER KIND OF HUB)) or mckenzie, my LTE is far superior. Though it is shorter, it has more FLAVOUR! Which means it is better. It is flavourful, like me. I am full of flavour and therefore flavourful just like cheeseburgers, which i keep craving for some reason. Maybe I'll get one later. ANYWAY Im in class and also anyway mckenzie has probably updated his LTE, which is cool, I haven't checked today but it is being updated very often now so it is a good bet. OMG AAAAAAAAAAAAA idk what to write about. I need to write because I'm like spectating the battle of knock person and mckenzie for 3rd place while i am in like 42nd place. SOI MUST WRITE LIKE MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. ALSO, I need to be writing an essay right now in class and instead I'm writing this. MAYBE, I'll submit this as my essay and the teacher will be so confused she gives me an A+++++. So you know the thought experiment where there are infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters hitting keys randomly and eventually they write everything right like litterally anything that has could or will be written is written by them at some point MAYBE RIGHT NOW. I think LTE's are a bit like that, so if I copy paste all the LTE's into the essay submission there has to be an arguementative essay in there somewehre right?!!? SOMEWHERE IN THE VOID A MONKEY IS WRITING THIS LTE.

MY IMENANT DEATH

GUYS GALS AND NON-BINARY PALS I MAY BE DYING. What I mean is, my mom got covid, and then I went over to my moms, and now a few days later; I FEEL SICK!!>!?!?! I may be a spreader of the covid-19 virus, maybe ill make a vlog about it. HEY PEOPLE, WELCOME BACK TO EPISODE 1 OF THE START OF THE END OF THE BEGINNING OF THE ONGOING INTRO TO MY OLD SERIES WHICH I JUST STARTED!!!?! I am the PATRON SAINT OF STRANGLY COLOURED PICKLES and I am sick with what is likely the COVID-19 virus and I am going to TAKE YOU ALL DOWN WITH ME! THATS RIGHT, im gonna try to spread this virus as much as possible against the wishes of the CDC. I am AT SCHOOL, cos I only feel like a bit sick at the moment, but it has gotten worse as the day progresses so it is entirely possible I won't go tommorow. But so like I need to write in this thing. But my brain is QUITE FRAZZELEd so im kinda currently unable to form many cohesive thoughts. WAIT lets go through my symptomssss, I have a headache, quite likely a fever, I am dizzy even while sitting still, my throat feels WONKY and weird and kinda hurts, I also have like a weird gooey irony taste in my mouth, not like blood but like a really bland ham sandwhich with a bit too much mayonaise and a side of PAIN. Also, im like generally weak and stuff, like tired mentally and pysically, well, more than normal. I also also also aaaaaaaaaaaa have a stomach ache a bit and occasionaly nausea (like the minecaft effect). So, its safe to say I feel kinda bad, and I am most likely actually sick and not just randomly having a headache like sometimes. I've felt like this since this morning and its gotten worse progressively throughout the day. I AM TIRED. So, honestly I should probably go home cos everyone I know is probsbly getting covid from me. However I had a brother also at my moms who was sick with like something other than covid ( i know who does and doesnt have it cos of tests), so IT IS possible I have whatever he did instead of covid whoever his sore throat was much worse and there were not as many additional symptoms so like thats good for him BUT THAT MEANS ITS MORE LIKELY COVIDDDSDAGE9WEFHDIUFBSA EEEEEE. Okay also, there is a person in d&d club who had an online (but still sexual) relationship with someone who was 21 years of age, but like they are a freshman and 14. So like thats probably not okay but they are both fine with it I guesss so idk what to do in that situation so I'm like just telling the non-existent fake imaginary people (and also mckenzie and knockdownton) that read my LTE. ANYWAY CLASS IS ENDING SO BYE UNLESS I UPDATE THIS LATER (I won't)!!!?!

tehe

mckenzies character count on the hub is inaccurate now. get trolled. cheeseburgers are cool aren't they. HAHAHAAH good luck with your cheeseburger.

so, things. dec 5 2022

but also no. So I HAVE COME (arrived not semen) to protest MCKENZIE because he is doing a thing. That THING is putting his LTE on a schedule of weekly updates on friday, where he updates the publically accessible BETA page and then pushes it to the main LTE. I HATE this, because this is just an extra button press to go to the beta page for no reasonnn. ALSO he FORGOT last friday and so the beta page update won't get pushed to the main LTE until this fir(tree)day (unless mkenzie complies with my complaints in a futile attempt to serve one of his very few frequent costumers). Anyway, bye. LISTEN TO CRYWANK OR I WILL EAT YOUR COLON. Seriously crywank is a really good anti-folk/folk-punk band, its really great and I've listened to ALL of it. I suggest listening to 'Fist Me Til Your Hand Comes Out My Mouth' LAST and 'Tommorow Is nearly Yesterday And Everyday Is Stupid' FIRST, and then 'Wearing Beige On A Grey Day' SECOND, and then test all the other albums to find your own order from there. ALTERNATIVELY you could listen to them in the order they came out for the crywank street cred (if any).But I suggest finding your own order first and then listening to them all in order to get the full story. (but I do suggest you always listen to the full albums at a time instead of switching it up at least at first cos swtiching can get chaotic cos of the crazyness and genre shifts). Anywya bye (no scam this time), unless.. JK (crywank song) I'm already dead (or whatever the old joke used to be). Honestly im just saying bye until class ends but idk when that is. ummmm.. nvm I suck so im gonna go and listen to crywank BYE. (also listen to my music too ig, come to my house and listen to me play live or smth idk, stalk me) DO IT STALK ME I DARE YOU AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh. Anyway, so.. LOL. Bye.. maybe. okay bye im breaking up with you never text this number again. die (like the singular of dice like in DND). Anyways, goodbye. Bye bye. Seeya, I hope I don't wake up the next time I slep. AAHHHHHH!! What please let me leave no no no. OKAY BYE FR RN TBH IMO!

day 1095

past day 1000 now, time flies when you're being tormented eternally! ANYWAY, I am so very sorry it has been a while I could lie and say I've been busy which would actually be true and therefore not a lie but instead im going to say the honest truth which is untrue that i have more important things for my lazy arse to be doing. Disregard that last sentence please, please, please, omg why won't you disregard it you stupid fu- . . . Okay I need to calm down.. takes deep breath and then dies. . . OKAY so I copied mckenzies idea of making a main site which was actually my idea that i said outloud (and maybe here but probably not) several weeks before he started making the main page so actually it was my own very original idea that I stole from like every website that has ever had a main title page thing. So anyway, the link to that is at the top of the thing. RN the button says potatoes but ill probably make it say something that isn't that soon. Additionally, I apologize for any spelling and grammer mistakes because I honestly couldn't give a flying chicken. Can chickens fly? If not, why do they have wings and look like they should fly, and if so why have I never seen a chicken fly? ANSWER DOWN IN THE COMMENTS. Actually, thats a good idea. We should add some sort of LTE comment system or chatroom so that we can communitcate with one another instantanously (according to nasa not really instant but screw nasa) without having to write an ENTIRE entry every single itty bitty little tiny time. BTW I myself am not talented enough to make this so mckenzie will have to make or steal one so I can then steal it from him cos he can code in javascript and I cannot. He even had to help me migrate over the java thing I stole where it displays a random subtitle thingy from a list of potential subtitles. Thats over on the main site which you should totally visit btw (logo and coolness pending cos its on backorder cos the supply chain shut down during covid and hasn't been able to catch up). FUN LTE FACT: the image of the pink pickle is an image I stole from some poor photographer (maybe) on the internet and changed the colour to pink. Not only was it not my image, I don't think the original was even pink.

day 1096

WOW IM UPDATING TWO DAYS IN A ROW!! that hasn't happened (to my knowledge idk maybe I decided to block an entry out of my memory cos it was too traumatizing) in like forever! Anyway, instead of doing my assignment for biologoy (spelled wrong) im doing this STUPID THING. Anywyayyssd wirgihrtiaegpaoi farj!!!! I came out to my step-mom and step-sister (whomst live with my dad) and I still haven't come out to my dad (as trans) but I need to so I was talking to my therapist about it and he said I should also so idk! Im gonna talk to my doctor in a couple weeks about anti-depressant dosage and im also gonna bring up HRT and to get HRT i need my dads permission (probably)!! SO yeah yeah yeah yeah segue that is very smooth! I am officially a professional music maker now cos I have made a GRAND TOTAL of 23 whole cents from people streaming my music across all the platforms. I know its only a few cents but like its still very weird to make money from a hobby, especially since my music is extremely obscure and unpopular. Maybe I could do music as a job one day idk, or at least make back the money I spend on music because I am currently very not profitable as a hypothetical buisness. I honestly was just updating my LTE today to say that I am updating my LTE twice in a row because MCKENZIE threatened me vaguely to update my LTE and now im UPDATING IT!!!!!!! Shutup mckenzie who isn't actually in the room with me but will be at lunch after this BORING AS SH*T CLASS ENDS AND ITS TIME FOR LUNCH NOM NOM NOM EATING TIME!! And I will continue working on my main page and LTE during lunch and make (force) mckenzie READ IT. Anyway, ummmmm.. I should really be paying attention to this class. But, alas; NO! ummmmmm.. I like my outfit today, I feel like the HOT and SEXY girl that I totally am on the inside (not the outside according to me). I have been feeling more confident in my GENDER recently and it is great for all aspects of my mental health. My therapist is proud of me (i think) cos im doing much better. The only reason I am able to recognize this is because im on DRUGS! Thats right folks, your (least) favourite best (worst) girl is on sertraline on the DAILY. And it actually has made my life so much better and stuff like sometimes now I don't wanna DIE which is crazy to me (very foreign feeling). I reccomend anyone who is mildly to SEVERLY depressed get some MEDICATION for it cos it can really help. OKAY I really need to do class work now; seeya all laters (or never depending on my continued existence and willingness to do stupid internet stuff). BYE :3

Okay Im BACK cos I made the main page MUCH BETTER. I added SPLASH TEXT with the help of mckenzie (again) and changed some other things also additionally. Btw the TEXTRA LTE was updated yesterdayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. OH yeah I also adjusted the titles of the pages and changed the favicon (to the trans flag for now until I get a better one which may in fact actually never happen in a million years). Hmmm.. I need to catch up on entries from the potato LTE.. maybe later when I have time cos right now I have to do other stuff for another class cos lunch with MCKENZIE (FROM THE MCKENZIE LTE) is over now and im dying. LATER PECULIAR PICKLE PEOPLE

day 1097

Okay so, I have a confession to make. IM SO SORRY. I ACTUALLY LIED. I just recently discovered that the pickle image at the top of this site is not at all my creation and I stole it from a 2011 deviantart page. I have sinned. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Also mckenzie how does it feel to have somebody else update their LTE faster than you?!? TEHEHEHEHEH :3

day 1098

FOUR DAYS IN A ROW (kinda). So currently its like 1:30 AM and so technically the next day. ANYWAY as returning readers can probably tell, the site is darkmode now to match the rest of my site!! COOL HUH!I will also eventually steal some of mckenzies code so that those who wish to be flashbanged by light mode can be. Also I updated the main site, which took more than an hour! Ya wanna know why the small updates after the chatroom addition took more than an hour? I DELETED THE WHOLE DAMN INDEX FILE. Through a series of unforunate events I ended up deleting my main html file and basically wiping the whole site. Luckily it wasn't too hard because the complicated bits (css infrastructure) were still there. BUT STILL it was a pain in the arse to clean up and rebuild. ALL FOR A STUPID (actually kinda cool) CHATROOM. Thats why its called "bad chatroom" because I sacrificed my whole damn site for it. I will rant more about this later but mckenzie is probably getting tired of my keyboard sounds in our (actually the d&d club) discord so BYE FOR NOW! :]

day 1099 (lyrics, i promise its relevant later)

okay so this is my fifth day in a row (technically speaking) updating my LTE. AND ITS OVER THE WEEKEND TOO!!!?! Which would seem to indicate I have no life. I've spent this entire 3 day weekend (it is currently monday but still the weekend) playing guitar, playing minecraft, and getting mad at CSS. That brings up an interesting point! It is currently monday, except since it is a continuation of the span during which I do not attend school I consider it part of the weekend (even though its not the weekend). SO, at what point does this feeling end?!? Like, winter break is just a continuation of a weekend for an extended period but I don't consider it to be a weekend? How long does a break have to be before we no longer consider it an extended weekend? Like, thanksgiving break is only like one week (max) but people call it "thanksgiving break"?!?!? How come nobody calls this break "presidents day break"??? Answer down below in the comments. ACTUALLY that reminds me!! YOU THE LOYAL (nonexistent) LTE READER can actually do THAT THING I TOLD YOU TO DO WITH THE COMMENTS!! Cos on my main page (link at the top, you can go to the top with the handy "top" button that follows you around wherever you go like a stalker (somebody needs to press charges against the "top" button). AND ALSO from the top there is a link that goes to the bottom (currently this entry but soon (maybe (oooooo, nested parenthesis)) another different better (worse) entry). Anyway about the comments thing, it exists!! Thats right guys, gals, and non-binary pals we have a CHAT ROOM (mentioned earlier) and also now a GUESTBOOK (more suitable for comments)!! So, go to the main site and leave your comments in the guestbook I suppose. And also admire the cool animations and splash text and everything (I spent way too much time making). Okay so, I am faced with a dillema (spelled wrong?); this dillema (spelling?!?!) is that this LTE is a record of myself dating back literal years at this point, and it would be quite embarrasing for anyone that I know IRL to read it. EXCEPT I wanna show off my cool website and also be able to host other personal projects on my cool website?? SO IDK WHAT TO DO. I don't wanna read through this whole thing and possibly leak my personal details and weirdness to my friends, BUT I wanna show off my website. ALSO, it would mean my friends (many if not most of which overlap with mckenzies friends) would be able to read MCKENZIES LTE, and IDK if he'd appreciate that because this is kinda our own little weird subculture and we don't need ANY WEIRDOS all up in our buisness. AN ADJECENT dillema (is that really how you spell it?) is that my MUSIC is something that would make sense to link on my website except my music isn't very mainstream and I think it is very bad, it is also very sad (mostly) and personal and I don't want everynody knowing my emotional state and worrying about me or something. SO IDK WHAT TO DO x2!!?! Another reason is that I wrote unrequited love songs about one of my friends (NOT ANYONE YOU KNOW MCKENZIE) and released them publicly and they are pretty vague but might have enough detail so they'd be able to figure it out which would be QUITE awkward! SO basically my choices are A: put my music on the site and then only mckenzie and a select few could access my dumb music and it wouldn't leak to the public but then I wouldn't be able to actively share my website with friends. B: Don't put my music on the site and then share the website with friends (risking people being weirded out by my LTE ig). C: do neither A, B, or D. OR D: do both A and B and just hope for the best. These are the options, and I must pick one. FOR NOW (as in like right now this present moment in time where it is monday, february (wtf why does that word have an R there) 20th of 2023 at 12:03 PM) I choose option C because it is kinda the default no action option and right now I'm still deciding on an action and therefore taking no action which is still one of the options for action which makes me feel like i'm doing something even though I am NOT. Actually, this whole project (LTE and site) are kinda just that. Me doing something to feel productive without being actually productive (unless you consider venting on the LTE and learning HTML and CSS to be productive (that arguement could be made but it would probably fail eventually when you look at LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE I COULD BE DOING)). HEY, this is a long entry. I haven't written this long of an entry since (checks when I made this length of entry last) LIKE THE BEGINING (spelling go brrrr) OF THIS LTE. WOWZA! This is GREAT NEWS!! HOWEVER THE BAD NEWS (that always seems to accompany good news for whatever reason) IS THAT I'VE RAN OUT OF THINGS TO WRITE ABOUT IN THIS ENTRY!!! That is very bad, but I knew this moment would come, for the last 10 or so minutes I've waited.. filled with dread.. and the moment is finally here (can you tell im stalling? probably. DO I CARE? HELL NO!!). I have completely run out of things to talk about (except for the default talking about running out of things to talk about). HEY that is a sneaky little paradox cos the more I acknoledge (spelling lol) that I talked about talking about about talking about talking about talking about (oh no) about talking about (make it stop) about talking about talking (god no its happened, the paradox has consumed my LTE) about talking about about talking about (wait) about talking about talking about about talking about (I have an idea) ABOUT TALKING ABOUT ABOUT TALKING ABOUT maybe if i start talking about something else it will end ABOUT TALKING ABOUT ABOUT TALKING ABOUT ABOUT TALKING ABOUT TALKING so, the fresh prince of bel-air theme song is actually a really good idea for that era of television. The song introduces the backstory of the characters and situation and so new viewers can hop in on the show in any epsiode (back when shows were aired sequentially instead of on-demand or streaming) and they'd have a general sense of what is going on because the episodes are (mostly) each a closed loop. EXCEPT just enough character development leaks through between epsiodes that it doesn't get stale for returning viewers and it rewards continious viewing after you've started. I think this formula is one of the biggest reason why the show was successful in its era. HEY, the paradox ended!!! I DID IT. WOO ME!! I solved a fictional problem of my own creation (by wriitng a very short introduction to an essay I will never write (or maybe will who knows) about the HIT TV SHOW The Fresh Prince of Bel-air. Now, this is a story all about how my life got flipped (turned upside down). And I would like to take a minute (just sit right there); I will tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-air. Hey wait, where TF is Bel-air anyway?!?! Like what state? IG i never paid enough attention, lemme google it. OKAY so he was west philidelphia born and raised right (on the playground is where he spent most of his days), and I've just now discovered Bel-air is a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. THAT MEANS HE MOVED ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY! Damn. That explains why there is such a culture shock for him, its literally all the way across the country. Poor Will Smith (the name of the character in the show is played by Will Smith; and the chracters name is WILL SMITH!!!! WOW SUCH AN INCREDIBLY CREATIVE DECISION!!!!!?! I wonder if the show featuring Will Smith (fictional) is based on the life of Will Smith (real actor) and thats why they are named the same???). Anyway, thats all for this incredibly long entry because I am bored of writing now and ran out of things to write about VERY long ago oh god wait......... okay good it didn't happen, phew. Anyway anyway, yo holmes smell ya later! Okay but seriously BYE BYE :3

but im full of sh*t, im a plagarist; as a liar im a ten. idk i forgor the day again

Oki so like aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Anyway. yes. what? MCKENZIE COPIED MEEEEE!! He did the top and bottom buttons thing that I wanted him to do AND HE DID IT BETTER!!1! DNA you mckenzie. I say DNA cos nathan in class said DNA quietly and mr. busch said "language" cause he heard some other No No Word (damn). ANYWAY I have nothing else to talk about, I should be taking notes in biology right now but I am not; instead im wasting my time doing this. Is that an insult to any potential reader? by saying this text is a waste of time am I insulting my readers (they dont exist so dont worry about it). Also, I kissed two DIFFERENT people yesterday. There is a small group of people who just.. kiss me sometimes. One has a BOYFRIEND and isnt really into me but the OTHER is VERY into me apparantly. There are approixmately 3 people currentlly openly into me and its very confusing. I don't particularly wanna date somebody right now and even if I did I would want to know them pretty well first, I like the idea of going from close friends to lovers slowly instead of just suddenly going out with somebody as a way of getting to know them. I might be fine going friends with benefits (with some of these people that like me not all of them) tho cos idk it might be fun to have meaningless sex occasionally. I mean, im at the age where its kinda socially expected I start doing things like that and whilst im open to the idea, I'm also quite awkward as a person. I'm not particularly good at getting jiggy with it if you know what I mean. Like.. in a romantic relationship it was fine I didn't have much experience cos we love eachother and whatever and the intimacy was more important than the actual pleasure BUT in a situation where im just doing somebody for the sake of doing somebody its more expected that i'm going to do well ya know? And like, im not actually bad at sex but like im still scared (quite possibly without real reason) cos these other hypothetical person(s) seem quite experienced (and kinky). This is a pretty personal conversation I probably shouldn't be talking about on the internet but hey this is a record of MY life so I can do WHATEVER I WANT. I am slightly scared of getting blocked by the school district for it though, they do tend to be pretty liberal (not in the political sense) with their blocking of sites. Especially since they (try to) block all personal websites and blogs, like its one of their things they want to block all of for some reason... . . . . . . . . I'm kinda out of things to talk about now. You probably don't care, because you probably don't exist (L! Imagine not existing). Oki I really gotta do biology stuff now so bye byeee

day

dear LTE; Mckenzie told me to update you, so I am. Isn't that great (spolier: no)!?!?! Anyways, I've started reading hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and it is absolutely unhinged. I'm at the point where arthur and ford get picked up by the heart of gold thingy currently (if that means anything to anyone?). BUT, I FORGOR THE BOOK IN PORTLAND. And so I don't have it. SO, tomorrow i'm gonna have to steal (another) copy from the library!!!!@! I already stole from the library the first time, but they have a second copy I think; so I have to steal that one nowwww! I am firmly against checking out books from the school libraries for obvious reasons (actually a very specific thing that happened in elementary school that you have no way to ever know about). ALSO, the mckenzie LTE is getting updated CURRENTLY!! EXCLUSIVE MCKENZIE LTE BEHIND THE SCENES CONTENT (PLUS MCKENZIE HAND REVEAL)!!!!!!

we're breaking up its not you its me

by "we're" breaking up, i mean me and the hypothetical (mostly nonexistent) LTE reader. WHY? because we were never together in the first place!! BUT also because I HAVE A BOYFRIEND FIJOSGHKJRPGOAIONBGUISVJE!!!! I am no longer your girlfriend nonexistent LTE reader; i am somebody elses girlfriend!! THIS has completely solved my whole contemplating being a wh*re dillema!! Because now i'm sociatally obligated to only do that kind of stuff with ONE person which makes the situation much less complicated because now i can reject people by saying "ummmm.. i have a boyfriend" like in the movies. I see people complaining online about how people keep rejecting people that weren't actually trying to make advances by saying "i have a boyfriend" but i've never actually see this occur unironically outside of movies so idk what all the fuss is about (if any). ALSO mckenzie is adding a "gallery" thing for howds related works of fine art. OKAY anyway go away stop reading my LTE i have a boyfriend (this is me rejecting your nonexistent advances whilst also bragging that i'm not an incel like (probably) most LTE readers). Anyways sorry for the nonsense entry i just wanted to brag :3

day of cheese

HAPPY CHEESE DAY TODAY IS april 13th!!!

day of reckoning

Good evening (it's 11 AM)! Okay so basically I have been an absolute NERD and not updated for a REALLY long time (idk it was probably a couple months or something) idk. I don't know what to write rn and it makes me ANGRY AHHHHHH!! I don't wanna write at all but I feel the need to update you on the fact i'm now WORLD FAMOUS!! Not only have I now made over a dollar from people streaming my music, but THERE IS SOMEONE NEW IN THE LTE HUB!! A new (VERY ACTIVE) LTE!!! ADDITIONALLY TO NOT WRITING MY LTE, I have failed to check any of the others either T^T!! This is a trajedy! Also, I've been quite active in web development still (YAY) just not on my LTE! I've made a website to host a game of diplomacy amongst friend (mckenzie included), I've worked on a website for my school, because the schedule was hard to find before and changes almost daily due to the frequency of events. I really don't know what to write now, no new updates. Me and my boyfriend are still together, very happily in fact. Thats not really entertaining news though, that's not what the people want! THEY WANT DRAMA, THEY WANT ACTION!! I however can't supply those things (except every 1-5 buiness days). MY life is not entertaining enough to blog about! I have stagnated! ALSO i'm behind on schoolwork with only a few weeks left and i'm doing this instead! What a waste of time and effort, but the small dopamine hits this gives me are working to keep me doing it. I have the follow the dopamine disorder (attention deficient hyperactivity disorder), and it's in full force today! I wish to get medicated, but i'm kinda scared of intoxication in others and myself so idk what i would get. AND my father (somehow) doesn't believe i have adhd (my mother (who has a psychology degree) does however, and she wants to get me medicated so ahhhhhhh)! Also i've become interested in coding (specificaly (Spelled wrong) simulations) recently, which is something i do mildly often actually. I may make a page on my website (link at the top to go to main page) to link to some things online i think are cool, that'd be fun.

day 1,288

HELLO AND WELCOME BACK TO THE WORLDS WORST THING (JUST THING IN GENERAL, THINK ABOUT IT, OF ALL THE THINGS THIS IS THE WORST ONE)!!!! It's been a bit (summer happened) but I'm back now! Sam updated his website! The new aesthetic is really cool. I'm jealous of his ability to make things look so cool. Also, I found the day again! It's now been over 3 and a half years since I started this LTE; wild. I feel like this community is really cool, the amount of people (under like 10 but still) that can come together from around the world (mostly just around the united states to my knowledge) to participate in this weird type of blog where you write everything on one page. An LTE is basically just a blog format, but it's taken on it's own life through the appreciation for the old web that comes with it. I mean, I've even seen people talk about MY LTE in their LTE; like how I talk about the flaming chickens LTE, and other pre-2010's LTE's. Maybe it's not significant, and maybe the most we've ever accomplished as a community is being in the background of a Jaiden Animations video; but it's had an impact on my life (in it's own distant sort of way, ig it was the thing that got me into web development). SPEAKING OF, some new LTE's have been discovered; and you can check them out at the LTE hub (link in description)! ACTUALLY I JUST CHECKED and mckenzie hasn't updated the hub yet! I'm SO ANGRY (mad)!!!!! This is outrageous or however you spell it!!!! The LTE's are Falcon's LTE and the book of monika. Tangent time. All of the following info is from google, i'm going to regurgitate what I read as absolute fact because google is never wrong. The average book is 50 to 70 thousand words long, the average word is around 5 characters. This puts the average character count of a novel at around 250,000-350,000 characters. This means there are several LTE's that could legitimately be considered novels (especially knocktons LTE which is egregiously (spelled wrong) long). Not mine though, not yet at least. Someday. Someday.. However, this does call into question what can be considered a true novel. Like, is this a book? If somebody makes an LTE, are they an author? Are they a writer? Sure, the book is a non-fiction (mostly) account of somebodies life; but loads of accomplished novels are. Some novels (although admittedly mostly bad ones) are written in a journal format. I watched the movie Arrival last night, and it totally broke my brain about the nature of language and such. It also used one of my least favourite interpretations of time, cyclical time. This basically means everything that will ever happen is predetermined and everthing will always go the way they go no matter what. This basically means free will is an illusion. Free will being an illusion is a thought that makes me deeply uncomfortable, but maybe that's what I'm supposed to say. Maybe right now I don't have free will, and this breakdown about the nature of free will was predetermined. Maybe this was meant to happen. TLDR: destiny sucks and I hate it but arrival is a really good movie and you should watch it (but only if you have the mental fortitude to endure an existential crisis). Okay, so back to the LTE's. I think there is a chance somebody is from outside of america. And we aren't really good at getting reliable dates for things. So, ya know how dates go month/day/year in america, well elsewhere things go day/month/year . And it's entirely possible we've miss-dated an LTE by reading the date backwards like a dumb american. So if you aren't american, SAY HOW YOU FORMAT YOUR DATES DAMNIT!! Speaking of dates, I'm still dating my boyfriend. He's great and I love him very much. Hi boyfriend if you ever read this (hopefully you don't)!! Oh no i've made a horrible realization! I've been basing the "day" off of when my site was created, but i forgor I didn't start my LTE here!! It was a google docs then a google sites then a wix site for like a day and then finally the cool neocities site you see today. But the real problem is that i now have NO IDEA when my LTE started! Lemme try to figure it out. I think in one of the earlier entries when i actually knew the day it i put what day it was so maybe i can get the day number from there. OR MAYBE I CAN FIND THE GOOGLE DOC!! yes, if I look at the google doc creation date i'll know when this LTE truly started! BRB gotta find the doc. Okay I'm back! It's only been 0 seconds for you (strange how time works). I have FAILED to find the original google doc, but i did find the google site! the google site was made feburary 25th, SEVERAL days before this site (made march 4th)!! Funny (not funny very bad) thing is this site was made only a few days before the school closed for quarantine, weird. So, this might actually be day 1,296?!?! It's close enough that i'm just gonna use march 4th from now on, but if you wanna manually correct for something closer to the real date just use feb 25th as a starting day ig. Although wait what day was I on when the google site first started?! Okay so i checked and apparantly i made it on day 12. so it might actually be day 1,308?!?! So, as far as I know; my LTE was started on feburary 13th of 2020. Also, i've noticed lots of LTE's nowadays adopting the "days" system. I think I might've been the first person to do the "days" thing, maybe i influenced that trend a little. AM I AN INFLUENCER NOW!?!?! omg i'm so cool (/j cos i hate myself). Okay enough for right now I need to take notes in class; bye bye!! :3



P.S: I eagerly await the next LTE update from mckenzie (and everybody else ig but MCKENZIE UPDATE YOUR LTE)


day more like gay (9/22/23)

hello loyal LTE readers (just kidding, i dont exist)! TODAY IS FRIDAY, FRI-YAY! However, I have 3 tests today, and i have 4 classes today, one of which doesn't do tests. Basically my whole grade for the next while depends on my mental state today; which is horrible. Horrible? BAD? YES!! My mental state today can't make it through normal classes, but i have three tests (none of which i studied for btw)!! I'm gonna fail everything today. Today likely could mark the begining of the end for me. WHYYYYY? Because my boyfriend who is like my moral support basically is GONE TODAY!! HE IS HOME SICK, THAT BASTARD! So, idk what i'm gonna do. These tests are worth like my entire grade and i don't think i can pass! i'd be lucky to get even a B! for added pressure if i get anything below a B my father has threatened me with a bunch of punishments of all sorts (mostly related to making me do more work, or moving me to a different school). He also recently said "if homework gives you anxiety, you need to do more homework", this is a direct quote from him. Not even missing context, he legitimately means i should do more work because it makes me anxious. His reasoning being that it will desensitize me to anxiety, which not only doesn't work because my anxiety disorder is clinical; but even if it did i wouldn't want that because i don't wanna live completely desensitized to thw world and spiteful (like him). This whole entry has been a vent so far. I'm also supposed to be doing something in class rn, but instead i'm listening to sad music and doing this. Maybe it'd be better to use this time for studying, but is it even worth it to go through the anxiety of thinking about the test before it happens (with the only benefit being that i might get like a very small boost in score)??!?! idk probably. I told myself this year i was just gonna suck it up and do everything, but i simply cannot. Like, i'm doing slightly better than last year but the begining of the year is always easiest. Probably because the pressure of a backlog of missing assignments builds up as the year goes along, making it harder and harder to work on assignments as they come in. The songs in the auto-generated queue of songs are just getting sadder and sadder. currently listening to tire marks by flatsound (great song btw listen to it if you can take very sad songs). An excerpt from the song is as follows:


if this is where the fire stops
keep me warm inside your arms
i want to be your final thought
when all that's left are tire marks


so yeah pretty damn sad. I really like the song tho, i aspire to make similar songs. I guess i do kinda make very similar songs. I pretty much ripped off flatsound for my whole musical aesthetic. Except some of the newer things, which are mostly slowcore and ambient. And now were back to the dilemma of whether to link my music here. I mean the only people that really know where to find this site are sam and mckenzie, and i don't think mckenzie would care all that much (does mckenzie even listen to music?!? i think the last thing i heard them listen to was a brilliant compostition called "rat repellant" which is very annoying high pitched tones intended to only be used to deter rats (it also makes humans want to run away). and i don't really know what sam would think of it, we have vaguely similar music taste so maybe they wouldn't hate it; idk. If i do link it, it'll probably be on the cool stuff page on my main site (go visit that, lots of cool stuff). okay class is over so bye for now!!


day of (10/3/23)

it is a great day, mckenzie is updating his LTE (longest text ever) (trade mark)! Yesterday was my schools "day of dance" and it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be but it was still pretty bad! The content of the dance day was okay but the actual DAY was horrible!! It is the day before the deadline of like all the assignments thusfar this year! It's as if the administration took the worst possible day (when everybody needed to get work done) and decided to make the "theme day" THAT DAY!! WHY!?!? ITS THE WORST DAY!! IT'S THE DAY YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO AVOID PUTTING THINGS ON (COS IT'S THE WORST ONE TO PUT THAT THING ON)!!!!! MY SOCK KEEPS RIDING TOO LOW ON MY FOOT!! BUT ONLY MY LEFT FOOT!! I keep having to take my shoe off to pull it back up except my shoes are hard to take on and off so it sucks!! Anyways, I have gone down another conlanging rabbithole.... mi kama sona e toki pona (mi pilin e ni: mi sona e toki pona tan jan Whiletrue). Additionally, i've also been researching other conlangs and just in general consuming content online made by the conlang community. I like finding niche communities (you can tell by the fact this exists and i'm still using it after many years). Also i've just realized Viba (Whiletrue) is still active, and quite possibly still is partially in the LTE community, so there is a small chance they are reading this?!? If YOU dear loyal LTE reader are actually the legendary WHILETRUE/VIBA, toki! lipu sina li pona mute tawa mi a! anyway moving on (slightly) i'm a big fan of nimisin (nimi sin, often combined as nimisin, meaning new words). I think the development of the toki pona community as a whole is very important, and i think inventing new words just makes the language better (like the subreddit desire paths, where people who want paths just walk off the paved paths and make new paths, these new paths are like nimisin, they make the existing route better). anyway, MCKENZIE YOU HAVEN'T UPDateD your LTE in ages!! MINUS 13 POINTS TO YOUR SOCIAL CREDIT SCORE!!! Despite this almost constant yelling by me, my LTE is actually shorter (by a lot) than mckenzies!!!!?!! This is because his LTE updates are simply MUCH larger. ni li ike a! I think at this point i just like reading the almost nonsense entries. I mean, if i didn't like reading LTE's i probably wouldn't make one. I wonder what aspect of this weird blog format is so appealing to this communiotiy (i've spelled community wrong i swear almost every time jesus). ANYWAY, i made the maybe slightly not really controversial decision to put my music on my website because i realized like nobody i know in real life knows about my site anyway!! Only sam and mckenzie do and i don't care if sam sees it (if he even checks these, if you do, hi sam!!) and mckenzie (i think) simply doesn't care1!!1! Also, i made a cute (simple) little website for my weird ass experimental ambient folk music. I mostly just re-used CSS animations from this site tho so it's nothing to write home about (don't write any letters, don't send them to your house, don't send them to my house, just burn them, burn the letters, put them into fire until they no longer exist. nimi "fire" li seme lon toki pona? seli could mean fire, but also like that could be too general out of context. I guess if you wanna say something like "my house is on fire" you could say "seli li lon e tomo mi" or "seli li pakala tomo mi". idk something like that. ANYWAY I gtg now, i gtg go do all the stuff (all the stuff is editing my movie for moving image arts (filmmaking)).


eon337 (10/6/23) (longest entry thusfar?!?!)

this might be the most important entry in this LTE thusfar. as you probably (don't) know, i've been searching for eon337 for years. and recently i've gotten back onto the trail, and i've had a BREAKTHROUGH!! First, i re-noticed the recent(ish) post on the eon337 deviantart page saying only "zampanio awaits". This led me down a rabbithole about whatever the heck zampanio is, and i figured eon must be a part of this community, a fan of this work. I continued my research, finding old threads on neopets and such, groups online also searching. most people had come to the conclusion that jenny had died somewhere around 2017 though. i always knew this to be UNTRUE because according to somewhere in the flaming chickens LTE (probably) jenny is immortal and cannot die. ANYWAY, long story short after following a bunch of leads to dead ends i decided to join the farrago fiction discord (farrago fiction is a website run by jaded researcher, the creator of zampanio). I searched "eon337" in this discord and found i wasn't the first to have searched for them here. Most leads there came up empty, until i met a user by the name of crimsondestroyer. We chatted for a while, he brought up the longest text ever hub and i was like "ummm yeah my friend owns that". he asked about the path that got me here, what i already knew. Apparantly, i had gotten pretty far on my own. at one point i said "imagine moving on, i've been at this for years". AND THEN they delivered the most EPIC cool ominous monologue in the history of the internet (imo). the link at the end leads to a site, in which it is confirmed that jadedresearcher IS EON337!! I was like "HOLY MOLY" and then they delivered this epiic sequel to their monologue, where they linked to what eon is currently working on (zampanio)! I had done it, i had found jenny (now in her mid 30's presumably). I found out that crimson actually had gone the other way, having heard of jadedreasercher first and then from there finding eon337 and the longest text ever. apparently eon (or jadedreasercher) is now at least aware of the people inspired by her old internet presence, and so there is a non-zero chance that you (the reader of my amazing (horrible) LTE) are jenny (theres also a chance you are named jenny and not in fact also eon337, which case hi jenny but go away); in which case: hi, i'm a big fan; you should do a guest rant on my LTE sometime. Additionally, crimson told me about an audio log thing on the farrago fiction website (btw it is so cool, i'm jealous). in this audio log jenny talks about how she dissapeared from the internet and unintentionally faked her own death. She also talks about a flaming chickens lunar colony roblox group that talks about her death (and she reads out some excerpts from the flaming chickens handbook, which is a real cool little piece of history, hearing her read it out). She appears to think this is very funny but I DON'T, you had us (us being the LTE community) worried for a second (a second being more than a decade)!! Like, you couldn't have said something sooner?!? I think that secretly, she wanted us to think there was a mystery, that she was dead or something. from what i know, that isn't an unsubstantiated thing to think. Also, isn't it weird how much you feel like you know somebody from their LTE. Because, in an LTE, you talk about the big picture stuff (what you like, what you HATE WITH A BURNING PASSION, what you love, what you do); and you also talk about the little day to day stuff, like what you should be doing instead of writing an LTE at that moment. And these two things are like a really good way to get to know somebody, you get to know how they view themselves, and also view them objectively in how they react to things that happen to them or in the world. Like, i feel a connection to the people who's LTE's i read. I feel like i know them. And if YOU DEAR READER exist, you know me i suppose. can we be friends? i like having friends (especially online because i'm bad at making friends online so when i do it's a big acheivement. The thing with that is that i don't like calling people unless i know them well, and over the internet calling is the best way to get to know somebody. I have a big problem with calls, idk why, they just make me anxious. ANYWAY, we're friends now! So, back to eon337. they apparently do ARG's and stuff now, so like, that's cool. As crimson told me there are more adventures awaiting me. ANYWAY, completely off topic but like MCKENZIE YOUR SITE IS ANNOYING, all of it is actually REALLY GREAT except that when i press the bottom button it doesn't send me all the way to the bottom of the page, and just to some area NEAR THE BOTTOM. there is probably a good reason for this, but not being able to see the bottom when i press bottom throws me for a loop. Where the hell did the phrase "throws me for a loop" come from?!? like i can't think of a single reasonable explaination fro why "throws me for a loop" would mean "confuses me". Anyway, i used anyway a lot. Like, a lotttttt. Perhaps i shouldn't use it, and not mark when i jump randomly from one topic to another at all. I probably shouldn't worry about this being comprehensible anyways, since like NOBODY, and i mean ZERO people are reading this. Except maybe mckenzie. Actually, i should probably stop saying nobody reads this, because i keep meeting people who actually do read LTE's. Like, people know about the longest text ever hub. Like crimson! hey, if you're reading this and the person that is you has the discord username that starts with crimso; hello! i hope you don't mind me putting our weird back alley discord conversation on the wider internet! i really like your monologue (ona li pona). Also, crimson watches jan misali (who is a youtuber that does a lot but is mostly known for their linguistics stuff)! There is a WEIRD overlap between LTE creators and readers and being or watching amateur linguists. How do you define a linguist? i am interested in and know probably more than your average adult (although i'm not an adult) about linguistics, does this make me a linguist? i mean, there isnt much "science" in the scientific sense in linguistics. i mean, there aren't many experiments. don't get me wrong there ARE experiments. but like, i feel like a LOT of people that are universally considered linguists (or even amateur linguists which are a type of linguist regardless) have not done experiments. So like, WHAT GIVES!?!!? WHAT IS GIVING? what is the nature of "giving"? i mean, it's like the transferring of "things" from one person or thing to another person or thing, but like what the things and people are really vague? ya know? most definitions are pretty vague if you don't see what they communicate in context. this is one of the things i LOVE about toki pona, is that it takes advantage of ambiguious words to be able to communicate ANYTHING with less than 200 words. this does however conflict with the fact i like nimisin? because like how can i love that the language is simple whilst also wanting to add more complexity? IDK. i have these sorts of internal dillemas all of the time, it's kinda one of my flaws. constantly thinking about nonsense and then second-guessing myself on the nonsense i think about. UGH! I'm in algebra 2 right now (wow i didn't say anyways maybe i can write without announcing my change to the next topic) and i'm VERY MUCH supposed to be paying attention right now but I'M NOT!! What do you define as a language? like.. i know english and spanish, making me bilingual; does knowing toki pona make me trilingual??!?! does the amount of lingual i am only count natural languages or do conlangs count also. i mean, esperanto is a conlang and that would definitively count.. maybe i am internally tokiphobic (the word i just coined for thinking that toki pona isn't a language because it's so small), toki pona being easier to learn than other languages doesn't make it not a language. PLUS, i feel it would be harder for english speakers to pick up than japanese or spanish speakers. i think knowing spanish has given me a huge advantage in learning and it's probably how i've managed to learn (i'm not quite fluent yet but i probably will be within a couple months if i keep up the same rate of learning) so quickly. i mean, i think i can communicate any idea in toki pona that i can in english, so that's cool? and i can understand anything written or spoken if they write clearly and speak clearly and slowly (my brain still has to translate most of the language to english in my head to understand, fluency is when you just understand what is said without having to translate to your native tongue/any other language, BUT i can feel myself getting better at understanding without having to say the whole thing again to myself in english; like i can do it for simple stuff. I am supposed to be doing a practice test in algebra rn, but i'm doing this instead; if i fail my test it's this LTE's fault and it will be FIRED from it's job (it's unemplyed). Mckenzie at the end of his latest LTE entry said that he will unspeakable and violent things if i don't check my LTE, good thing by writing my LTE i'm checking it? i couldn't bare reading my old entires again. My schools d&d club started back up again, that's cool. i made a website for the club where i linked to a really funny old video of the proctor of the club, it's not even entirely embarrassing funny because it's him doing bo burnham style muscial standup comedy (or in his case sit on stool comedy). this isn't me calling his comedy derivative of bo burnham, it's HIM calling his comedy bo burnham style, in the video he calls it that, i'm not mean i swear. i feel mean a lot, like i feel like a mean person in general, even if a lot of people call me a nice person. i AM mean to some people, and i am instantly mean without provocation sometimes. Although, i think that's because i feel the persons bad vibes and so i am mean to them; at least, i hope that's why, maybe i am just a mean person. mckenzie, being a great amazing 10/10 frien said he'd listen to my music in his most recent entry, that's cool. Okay, i have monday to study this practice test before the test, so i think i'm gonna forgo doing the practice text today (friday) in favour of doing this LTE update. Is forgo a real word? i feel like you (loyal reader or whatever) know what i mean if you have a vocabulary bigger than a squirrel (surprisingly large), but like, why does it feel like i'm spelling it wrong?!?! i feel like a lot of questions in this LTE could be answered by simply googling them, but by not googling it i get more AMAZING CONTENT for my LTE (patent pending). oooooooooooo, btw people have left comments on my site!! i am going to look at them some of them here i suppose. we've got FALCON XW PLAYS (another LTE'er) saying "hello there matey": HI FALCON, cool LTE you got there, you should update more often!! we got my fren sam going "BOO" to which i respond "AHHHHHHHHH OMG A GHOST HOLY FRICK OH GOD FRACKEN RUN RUN AWAY!! MONSUTA LI LON! MONSUTA MOLI KON LI IKE! O TAWA WEKA! O TAWA WEKA!" "Cargon" says "hey bbg *blowing kiss emoj x2*", WHO IS CARGON?!?! NO. I AM NOT YOUR BBG!! I AM ONLY THE BBG OF MY BOYFRIEND?!?! REVEAL YOUR TRUE IDENTITY AND REPENT YOUR SINS!! Then, we have "troon" that says "ywnbaw". erm.. hi troon whomever you are! wtf is a ywnbaw?!?! "cobson won" says "ywnbaw and hwabag". WHAT ARE THESE THINGS?!?! mi sona ala toki e nasin toki sina! then finally "ywnbaw" says "ywnbaw", this last one happened less than a day ago! it says 20 hours ago!?!?! WTF! it is so strange that people actually visit my website and that there enough of those people to leave comments?!?! and then also WHAT IS YWNBAW?!?! is this a real acronym for something?!? this is another one of those situations where google could probably help, and solve the issue, except i get more content if i don't so i won't!! ANYWAY, if you want me to talk about you in my LTE; leave a comment (like and subscribe)!! if you want to "like and subcribe" i think you can actually do equivalent actions on my neocities profile? so like, follow me on neocities ig?!? alternate to that (i couldn't spell alternatevly, alternitivly, alternativly? ahhhhh) you could go to my yt channel (for my music) and subcscribe to me there? and then you could actually comment like and subscribe to me because you would be on youtube or whatever. did you know jadedresearcher has a youtube, there is even videos with facecam to compare to the only existing pictures of jenny on the flaming chickens website (the resemblance is uncanny because they are literally the same person)?!?! the more the class drags on and i keep typing whilst others at least pretend to work really makes me think i should at least start this practice test. also, i'm a sophomore now, except i'm a LITERAL GENUIS (just kidding i'm actually so slow idk) so i'm in a grade level above where i should be in math. this becomes much less impressive when you realize how many others are in sophomore year and in this class with me, i was far from the only one. my spanish teacher kinda is bad at teaching spanish (i was in 6 years of spanish emersion classes in elementary school but i forgot a lot and need highschool language credit so i'm doing it), like i've been able to correct her on her spanish several times so far and it's honestly worrying because she's teaching these children spanish WRONG. the other day she said "bonita" meant "pretty", which is fine on it's own but this led a student to say "so can you use this like "it's pretty hot in here?" and i was just like WOW that question is objectively bad. like ya know when you're in class and see somebody answer a question and you're just like "damn that is a bad question" i mostly thought this because of how incredibly anglocentric it is that this student thought this, like pretty meaning "beautiful" and "a little less than very" in english is pretty exclusive to english (heheheehehe get it? cos i used pretty in the weird way english uses it?)! then the teacher was like doing a "giving them the benefit of the doubt and explaining how it worked in language that made it seem like they were kinda correct" which i HATED because they were WRONG! then i realized this whole issue could've been nonexistent if the teacher would've just defined it better like "it means good looking, like beautiful" to avoid confusion! like, most anglocentrists like that will think that all other languages are just english relexes (relex is a linguistics term not a misspelling of "reflex"), which is NOT the case!! i didn't eat this morning (breakfastless) and now i'm in pain in the stomach (lunch made it a little better). this pain is actually a good thing, because it wouldn't have happened before. i mean, i used to never/rarely eat breakfast, and so i wouldn't get pain from this; unfortunately this turned into me not eating lunch and then not eating dinner and then not eating for days at a time. once i had a boyfriend tho things started to change especially once he noticed (i'm hesitant to call it an eating disorder but he did and it does kinda fit the description), and he would force me to eat even though i refused a lot. so eventually he got a good grip on my eating schedule and has made me (most of the time, i still have times where it shows it's face) mostly eat. and so me being in pain from not eating a meal rather than not eating for days is a really good thing!! let's hope i can keep this regular normal not refusing to eat habit going. this class ends in 5 minutes, so much for doing that practice test! anyway, (this anyway was justified because i said so idk i hate myself and my lack of consistency" this means i must pack up and leave! goodbye for now, maybe i'll write more later but probably not (maybe because i have run out of meaningful things to talk about, actually wait i never had those to begin with). mi tawa! mi olin e sina (/platonically)!

P.S:
I JUST REALIZED, ACCORDING TO CHARACTERCOUNTONLINE.COM I HAVE JUST REACHED OVER 100,000 CHARACTERS!! THAT LAST ENTRY PUT US OVER THE THRESHOLD! This site also shows me word density, the top ones are "like" and "LTE" and like, i don't like say "like" like that often do i?!?! Like i feel like i don't like say it every like couple words. LTE makes like a lot more sense tho, because i say LTE a LOT! combined, "like" and "lte" make up 4% of the total words in my LTE, crazy! Also i say mckenzie 56 times, well now 57. wow, i feel like a proud mom. my LTE is all grown up now. i'm almost exactly halfway to beating the flaming chickens LTE in characters! So, at the current speed (it's likely to slow down after i graduate tbh), another 3-4 years! Also, we're coming up on 4 years of LTE in approx. 4 months!


good mornin' (10/12/23)

okay so i'm once again supposed to be taking notes but instead i'm doing this. i have recently updated my main site and got rid of the useless chatroom, it was kinda just a test thing anyway; i only put it there because there was nothing else on my site at the time (now there is much more lol). I moved the "cool stuff" button over to where the button for that was. it is admittedly a little smaller than the other button now, i tried my best to fix it but i gave up really quickly and so you guys just have to deal with that now, sorry. my site is much less "clean" now which i kinda like, and so it being a bit off fits the aesthetic. anyway, i found this new video sharing platform thingy for toki pona language content, and nobody had posted a video there yet. so i made a really quick toki pona dub of "me at the zoo" (if you don't know, that was the first video posted onto youtube) and posted it on the platform. i contemplated the translation of "zoo" for a while and settled on "tomo soweli" but i feel like that is a little too nice to zoos (which are kinda a horrible place for animals), maybe "tomo awen soweli" which might be something like cage but idk for the sake of simplicity i just translated it to tomo soweli. people will get it via context because they know the title of the original video and so i just needed to translate vaguely. in other toki pona news which apparently a lot of people that read LTE's will understand (see my last entry where i might mention that LTE's have a weird crossover with conlanging), the "lipu tenpo" site is down; i asked on the discord and nobody seems to know why? they said it isn't a web hosting problem or anything, so nobody knows why the site is 404-ing. btw if you don't already; if you know toki pona you should lukin e lipu Lipu Tenpo, it's a community made newsletter for toki pona and just general news in toki pona (theres also fun comics and stuff which are my favourite part).


day 1,341 (10/16/23)

hiya! i've been trying to update this more frequently. "WHY??!?!" you may ask in a tone of voice and volume that doesn't match the current eepy vibes. well, the truth is (the objective truth in this instance is conciously NOT the same as my subjective truth, isn't that like.. weird?) i don't know why i want to write this. MAYBE, PERCHANCE, i want more characters on this LTE. I mean, that's why this exists, isn't it. just to mindlessly write as many characters on a page as possible. I'm in a tired mood today, it's monday. i'm in a moderately boring educational class. i also don't really have any friends in this class, i have some aquiantences, and one kinda friend (ya know, the kinda friend you only talk to in one class). BUT, the kinda friend is gone today for whatever reason (we aren't close enough for me to know why their gone so that gives you an idea as to the dynamic IG), so i'm bored. the only other person that sits at our table is friendly, but i don't even know their name so i'd hardly consider us more than aquaintences. Although, i find names hard to remember sometimes. Like, there are friends that i have where i kept forgetting their name, and eventually i renamed them to something more memorable. I just decided to start calling them something else despite their best efforts. i guess you could call these "nicknames", but they aren't really shorter versions of their names, just completely seperate ones (for example: britney, brandy, rosie. holy wait that's a weird pattern. maybe i really like names ending in "e" sounds, weird. they must be more memorable to me for some odd reason). should i figure out the day for this entry? i probably should huh. ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. i guess i will, but not because you told me to (you didn't, you probably said "i don't care" in your head), but because i want to (i don't, i'm lazy). i wish the apostrophy (is that spelled right?) key was more easily accessible, i mean, i use it less often than the semi-colon, and the semi-colon is more accessible. WHY? why are people in modern society so obssessed with effeciency but not on stuff like that. maybe it's my fault because i'm too lazy to change my keyboard layout, probably that. Also, speaking of the day; i've decided to from here on out (if i remember) to count the days starting from feb 24th, 2020 instead of march 4th, 2020. because feb 24th is a more accurate date, and i wanna have an accurate 4 year anniversary date for my LTE. btw it's currently been ~3.7 years since i started this LTE (assuming a year length of 365 days, not accounting for possible leap years because LOL who tf does that (i would but i need to focus on math class; just kidding, i don't exist!)). i've been playing some on the ma pona pi toki pona minecraft server, the server is INSANE. Like, there are free elytra at spawn and such; the server is in LATE LATE game! there's also no formal rules, they'll probably ban you if you start griefing but very little greifing happens cos like everybody is pona to eachother there. anyway, i built a house in the sky for funsies. i'm really self-conscious about getting in the way on servers like this, like i feel like my builds are intrusive or whatever. idk. i also found a road with a bunch of noteblock songs on it stored underground, so there was just a bunch of buttons that play various songs (among us theme, minecraft songs); so i added the day theme from terraria which took longer than i would care to admit. The main bit was fine, but i spent at least an hour getting the left hand melody. the left hand (bassy low melody) was playing the same thing over and over, so i decided to just make the loop once and then perfectly loop the noteblocks a certain number of times, which required weird hopper clock redstone trickery. overall i'm really proud of it. so proud i decided to violate my own rules i imposed on myself about not building anything large or intrusive around spawn and built a big terraria bunny in pixel art above the button. i think making the thing would've been much easier if i didn't do it in a very small underground space working around all the other stuff underground arounnd spawn, i even found an entire abandoned underground town which somebody built and furnished but never added an obvious entrance to. like, i bet most people don't know about it but it's a pretty giant build directly underneath spawn. minecraft servers la (i like using the toki pona work "la" in english now, good way of segue-ing) mckenzie should re-open the mckenzie SMP or whatever, maybe even the one on the school computers. theres a power vaccuum in cool un blocked stuff after the skyview MC server presumably went down, along with GTOH. i like social experiments like that, where the whole school gets to interact together in a virtual environment and form groups and such. idk. i don't know a lot of things. i'm once again supposed to be doing algebra but am doing this instead, but homework is a negligible amount of my grade (tests are 90%), and i do pretty well on tests so i'll be fine. i'm going over to stay in my grandmothers attic (not quite an attic but a weird upstairs room in the roof (furnished and everything tho idk)), because my grandfather (really my grandmothers boyfriend of like several decades) is away for the week and my grandmother is bad with being alone (like she gets really anxious and stuff) so i'm gonna be over there just so she isn't alone in the house. i can also help take care of the dying dog. this dog (cute english bulldog named Darby) is like several years past when her breed is supposed to die, and the doctors told her she had 1-3 months to live.. almost 2 years ago!! she's had cancer and shit and gone untreated cos she's supposed to die anyway and she's still alive and healthy (healthy in this case meaning not in pain, she'll still probably die soon lol). so, she was supposed to die long ago and just is still here somehow.. i guess she wanted to lay around the house for a couple more years. one thing i appreicate about her being so old is that she is more cuddly now (even though shes not great at it cos she's so fat and stuff), she's a good pillow though. the neocities logo in the top left of the neocities page looks like this for some reason, does anybody elses look like this?!?! what does this mean?!?! mckenzie, buddy, pal, chum, friendo, you've been working on the LTE rules page for like several years. LTE RULES PAGE WHEN!?!? LTE RULES PAGE WHEN MCKENZIE?!?! WHEN IS IT COMING OUT?!?! I PERSONALLY VOTE FOR YOU TO FAIL THIS SCHOOL YEAR IN ORDER TO PRIORITIZE YOUR LTE AND THE LTE HUB!!!!!!!!!!!! sorry, i'm too eepy today to be yelling like that. speaking of, i was recording screamy vocals the other day and a geninuely hurt my throat, like i yelled so loud it immediatly strained my vocal chords, that was pretty cool (in a grungy type of way) ngl. i'm tired, like i feel like that feeling when you get out of a hot shower and just want to lay down, i have that feeling, contstantly. tenpo kama lili la tomo pi kama sona ni li pini. ni la tenpo ni li tenpo pi mi weka! mi tawa!


day 1,344

what popping people of the internet?! hey internet, don't you agree mckenzie should update his LTE instead of being a nerd and quitting entirely? The internet responds "yes, i do" and bows to you cordially. SEE??!?! even the embodyment of the internet wants weekly mckenzie LTE updates to return (bi-weekly sucks and it is bad and slow)! my boyfriend said he was gonna try to look for my website, UH OH. good thing he'll never find it in the sea of the internet. if the internet was a city, this would be the back alley you can only get to by going into a different (presumably front) alley. what is the difference between a back and front alley? what is a front alley? anyway school is going to end at approximately NOW, so byeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! :3


day of sad

bad things happened. to me specifically. over this last wonderful weekend i was kidnapped once (twice depending on where you're standing, or maybe still once if you stand in a very specific place). to clarify, i'm not joking. anyway, moving on to things that will distract me from my mental state; such as the good old pastime of talking about the LTE community. we (meaning me and mckenzie specifically) have accidentally set a bar of entry for LTE's. LTE's nowadays are measuring themselves based on whether or not they are longer than "BusterDdogs boring life" or whatever (which was my IRL friends who is like that one distant jock friend but like at the time i convinced him to make an LTE we were closer and then he completely forgot about it). ya know when you have a friend for so long that you like drift apart and together and back again over and over, relationships are like sin waves (waves of sin, sinful waves). anyway i have a couple friends like that, where we're still like besties based on history, but like we don't talk for months at a time. but, if we were to hop into a VC together we instantly have that same energy as a decade ago. those kind of relationships are cool. anywho, idk what to talk about now. so now i'm doing that thing where i talk about not having things to talk about and then talk about that in an endless loop that ultimately does nothing but artificially inflate the length of this text which is actually the point so i guess it makes sense that would be where this keeps going. i mean, that was one of the first things i did here; and many years later, i'm still going. i think this weird longest text ever thing is the most commitment i've ever showed toward one project somehow. back to yelling at mckenzie now: MCKENZIE YOU ABSOLUTE BAFFOON YOU BETTER NOT QUIT THIS NOW IT'S BEEN SEVERAL YEARS YOU'RE IN TOO DEEP TO SUDDENLY DISSAPEAR NOW (don't be like jenny). i very much feel like $%!# right now, like emotionally and physically (i think i feel bad physically mostly because i feel bad emotionally, these two things have a strong correlation for me (to the point of causation)). honestly i think i'm doing badly in school right now, like i should work this week but i have a feeling i'm not gonna be able to get anything done this week. MCKENZIE LTE is probably the best work of literature written by mckenzie, like easily could become a copypasta (as confirmed by other LTE copypastas). ACTUALLY no it's not because "this is ep]c" exists. that document is the U.S constitution google translated to russian and copy pasted several (3?) times, and a nice picture of a dog (in the snow)? i feel like mckenzie should make that document public on his website in some way or another; THE WORLD NEEDS TO SEE IT, IT NEEDS TO BE WITNESSED!! i feel a deep seated resentment towards myself building at every waking moment. okay good(bad)byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeee! :3


day 1,338

okay so like the day says 1,338 cos i googled days since feb 24th 2020 and it said it had been that many days but the last time i googled that it'd been MORE DAYS!?!?! WHAT? okay so i did the maths and it turns out i accidentally wrote 41 instead of 31, and then i calculated the next day number based on that one so that next one was wrong too. i would retroactively fix this, but then i wouldn't have anything to talk about and i NEED things to talk (write) about. i notice people say talk instead of write a lot in LTE's (by people i mean me), maybe because LTE's are unbound by normal writing rules and are (mostly) ENTIRELY stream of consciousness. what is conciousness? how would one even go about begining to answer that question? i mean, you look at a rock; not conscious (i feel like i'm spelling that wrong). but you look at a human; very much conscious. at what point between the rock and the human does consciousness happen? is a cell conscious? if you define a cell as not being conscious, then how are you (nothing but a collection of cells) conscious?! if that rock from earlier (probably the same rock but you can't really tell all of the avaliable hypothetical rocks look the same, i wish i could get some quartz or something more hypothetically significant) had a cell on it, would the whole rock be considered conscious? how do you define the rock vs. the ground? is EVERYTHING COLLECTIVELY CONSCIOUS AND LIVING?!?!?! anyway have fun with those questions i have to leave (probably). silla (chair in spanish)!!!!?!

HEY GUYSIFHSUI!! sorry for toki-ing usando un lenguaje differente! a! mi pakala! mi wile ala kepeken e toki Epanja! mi wile ala kepeken e toki pona! mi wile kepeken toki Inli a! ENGLISH NOW! ENGLISH TASO! I MEAN ONLY! ENGLISH ONLY! AH! anyways now that that is over (ha, "that that" makes sense, english is weird), i can talk about things and have people actually UNDERSTAND (assuming anbody is reading this, i do assume that alot, and it isn't a totally unfounded assumption but it is one nonetheless)! however, class is ending now so i might dissapear.. okay seeya if i decide to write more today (hopefully in english!)

HEY I'M BACK (it's only been less than 30 minutes (i guess for you it's been about 0.5 seconds but whatever)), so i'm doing some rubiks cube solving again. i forgot how fun it is. i can still consistantly solve a 3x3 in under a minute, which isn't impressive; but it is to me because i haven't practiced or anything in like a year or more. i'm taking psychology notes right now, so i'm like writing a sentance here then taking some notes then writing another single sentence etc. "et cetera" NOT "etcetera" like some people say! it's two words!! the two words actually mean "and the rest" in latin. there is such a weird overlap between english and latin. DEFINE CHAIR IN A WAY THAT INCLUDES ALL THINGS THAT ARE CHAIRS AND DOESN'T INCLUDE ANYTHING THAT ISN'T A CHAIR!! IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!! that sounds like a splash text i would put on my main page. maybe i should (maybe i did, you'll never know (unless you find out (you'll never know what you don't find out))). i like nested parenthesis, can you tell? i wonder if any of this would still make sense if you removed all of the stuff i wrote in parenthesis.. does anyone actually read like that? probably not. do i need more things to talk about meaninglessly? probably. i'm dizzy today. i think i'm a bit dehydrated and i also didn't eat breakfast, maybe that's why? i also skipped lunch yesterday. idk. the word "cheeseburger" is ALWAYS in my head! like.. i like cheeseburgers but not THAT MUCH!! I LEGTITIMATELY THINK OF THIS WORD 24/7!! i haven't been able to do anything productive since the incident this last weekend, i'm just too anxious and sad and insert other negative emotion here to do ANYTHING. i am geniunely a failure i think. like i have accomplished nothing in the eyes of myself and my parents. idk. i'm like dissociating now, so i'm gonna stop writing before this gets too depressing. OKAY BYE!! HA, TRICKED YOU! you thought i was gonna stop writing my LTE just cos i feel like absolute $@#%?!?! NEVER! i don't need a break! i'd rather break.. down.. ANYWAY LET'S DO SOME MORE MINDLESS RAMBLING! BLAH BLAH BLAH! i think i'm having another LTE incoherent era (trademark)! did i ever have a coherent era? idk, i'm too incoherent to tell. i wanna talk and spend time with my friends right now but at the same time hearing about fun stuff they did reminds me of how little fun i've been having lately, and i get all sad or whatever. wow, i'm in a bad mood this entry. let's LIGTHEN IT UP. let's make it brighter (noooo wrong kind of lighten). you ever think about how lighter/brighter colours are also physically lighter/brighter? like they have more white in them which means they reflect more light, and are therefore physically brighter aswell as being percieved as a lighter colour. maybe this sort of thinking only makes sense (or is interesting in any way) to me but this is MY LTE and i can talk about whatever i want! like rubiks cubes! i need to memorize the 5x5 parity algorithms but i haven't learned a new algorithm for anything in a LONG TIME so idk if it's gonna be easy (especially because i'm REALLY slow at 5x5, mostly because i make no attempt to be fast because the way you solve it is very satisfying to me). also i just heard max park got like a 36 second average on 5x5?!?! that is so fast! like JEEZ!! it takes me like 7 minutes MINIMUM (idk i haven't timed myself), plus having to look up the parity algs when i get parity (which is always because god hates me)! okay class is over now so bye but like for real this time (probably not actually i might write later idk).

i'm in yet another class now, i forgot a pencil so i'm using that as an excuse to do things like this instead of boring math. MCKENZIE I SWEAR TO (the almighty pie) GOD this LTE rules page better be the most EXTENSIVE LENGTHY rules page EVER! it has taken you so many years to make it better be like the longest rules ever (the long awaited sequel to the longest text ever format)!! how are people supposed to know how to make an LTE if you don't directly tell them by using an IP scraper to find their address and then come to their house (dropping in through the chimney like santa is preffered, but if this option is not available for whatever reason you can break and enter the normal way, or if you really want you can just enter normally by like knocking on the door or whatever) and make them tea (or coffee, your choice) and then sit down and personally tell them about how to make an LTE (perferably playing the role of the reluctant mentor but an enthusiastic mentor works too it's just not as entertaining for the audience as the reluctant mentor trope is, so like your call but i highly suggest acting like you secretly hate your LTE student)! so like.. what was i talking about?? idk. ANYWAY, i should do another sweep for more LTE's; i haven't done one of those in a while and somebody might've made a new one in that time? probably not but it's worth a shot, ya know? HEY if you're reading this and you have an LTE submit it to the LTE HUB!! and if you are reading this and you are mckenzie you should probably check your emails to see if anybody has emailed about the prestigious title of "one who is listed in the LTE hub as an LTE". ya know, we might literally have EVERY LTE that has ever been made in the hub.. like, i wonder if there are others out there somewhere? maybe the longest LTE is one that only the creator (and that one friend you tell about it cos we all have a friend like that) knows about. i may never have the longest LTE, but it's about the journey, not the destination. does that metaphor (is that a metaphor or just a saying?) work if the destination keeps moving? like the "longest LTE" is not a static thing, it's a title awarded to the longest known LTE. this class ends in approximately 12 minutes, that's a boring number. don't some numbers bore you? like there are some numbers that are just inherently boring (like 12, 50, 25, 162, etc (to be honest it's mostly just even numbers and multiples of 5))? after this school day is over, guess where i go! go on, guess! I SAID GUESS! okay good. i'm assuming by now you guessed something at least subconciously. i go to d&d club! woooooooooo! i was thinking about how to say dungeons and dragons in toki pona. perhaps "musi pi tomo anpa en akesi seli" but idk if "en" is usable this way, it's used to indicate multiple subjects but there isn't necesarily a subject here, it's a proper name? it translates literally to something like "underneath house and fire lizard", which is fine. now that i think about it they kinda are subjects, so like.. i'll keep the "en". anyway "underneath house/room" is like a pretty vague translation, so maybe something like "tomo monsuta" which approximates "house/room of monsters" or "scary house/room" would be more pona. of course these translations aren't very exact because toki pona words don't correspond at all with individual english words, they have a much wider semantic space each (semantic space being linguistics jargon for "range of meaning"). anyway class is ending (again)! mi tawa! sina lukin e ni la sina pona!!

dang i stopped speaking english again!! i promise (i don't really) that i will continue habla-ing Ingles por todo el tiempo! on no i'm speaking spanglish again! darn! dang! dangit! dagnabit! shucks! heck! carp! now i have a longer class with pretty much nothing to do! i should probably do some work for other classes but like LOOL i ain't gonna do that, that is cringe! work is cringe! food, water, and shelter should all be free (am i a socialist?)! neocities recognizes the ampersand (&) as a special cool coding-related character and so whenever i use it it GIVES ME ERRORS ABOUT EXPECTED NAMED ENTITIES!!! AHHHHHHHHH!! i'm going to our schools equivalent to homecoming soon (it's called fall ball instead cause my school is quirky) and it's gonna be my first time going to a highschool dance (woo)! i'm not looking forward to it (aww) because i hate social events like that but my boyfriend wants me to go and my friends are all bringing their partners (one of my friends is bringing their friend who they want to date but like they aren't dating but they invited them to a dance which is a date so like oooooooooooo). i need to stop writing because i don't want this to be my longest entry. like that entry that i made before had so much more effort put in (years of cybersleuthing culminating in an epic monologue and a big reveal) and it deserves the recognition of being the longest entry in my LTE thusfar (the highest honor i can bestow upon an LTE entry). i've made a mini-entry for each class i've had today (i've had 4 classes today which correspond to 4 mini-entries). that's kinda cool, not very cool tho. it's only like a little cool in this hyperspecific context. my declining mental health has been really bugging me as of late. idk why, i just really want to be happy right now and i'm NOT and it's making me ANGRY which is NOT HAPPY AHHHHHHHHH!! i sure am writing a lot for somebody who just said she needs to stop writing. she just referred to herself in the third person, she is so weird. i should put these entries into a character counter to compare them, and then see how many characters i have left before i catagorically MUST stop. oh WOW i just looked and apparantly i have around 6,000 characters left! dang! i don't have to worry at all! so then why am i worrying? use the standard LTE information/teaching precedure to tell me EXACTLY why i continue to worry despite all logical reasoning! do you like cheeseburgers? i kinda do, but i don't like love them.. SO WHY DO I KEEP THINKING ABOUT THEM THEN!?!?! i'm not even thinking about cheeseburgers themselves, i'm thinking of the literal WORD "cheeseburger"?!!? I DON'T KNOW WHY?!?! you know what else i don't know (that is a weird sentence)? i don't know why i bother to use apostrophes (the little thing in the middle of the word "i'm") when i don't bother capitalizing anything?!? i also over-punctuate despite not using case execept to indicate enthusiasm.. weird. i guess in my nasin (nasin is a great toki pona word that encompasses the idea of religions, personal philosophies, pathways, as well as literal pathways and roads and stuff; the closest english word to it is probably "way") punctuation is not really important because it doesn't convey any meaning except to sometimes indicate proper nouns (which is moderately useful). capatilazation at the beginning of sentences is COMPLETELY useless. so in my nasin for writing i don't use them (unless i'm being formal or whatever. it's just slowly become less and less formal as time goes on i think. i'm relaxing into a bit of an LTE-ing groove right now. should i keep doing that think where i say the exact amount of characters i'm at? NO?!?! too f-ing bad!! well, as of that last exlamation mark (it marks an exclamation!) i'm at 129,216 characters! very nearly to 130,000! i think i've wrote more in this past month than i have in like a decent amount of my LTE, like this time period accounts for like a quarter of the total weight of my LTE! i need to use "like" a little less perchance. i don't want it to be my most used word anymore. idk why but it makes me feel l*ke a sterotypical teenager. ha! i censored my word in that last sentence and then i read it as "lake" instead in my head. lakes are cool. bodies of water just kinda not connected to anything else (except for glaciers and stuff sometimes). idk how lakes work.. how do they stay filled? how does all the water not stagnate and get all gross (i'm aware it does soemtimes but like why isn't it more gross)... IS THE WHOLE OCEANS JUST A GIANT LAKE?!?! IS EARTH A LAKE?!! OH GOD. i've got 30 minutes left until the end of the school day (then i go goof off at d&d club). people misuse the word (abreviation) "AI" a LOT! most of what people call "AI" is actually better catagorized as machine learning. actual "AI" doesn't exist because AI means that the AI is fully concscious and aware and think on it's own and that currently (to my knowledge) doesn't exist. that doesn't mean i will stop using AI that way though, because i am just so cool like that. i think it will happen soon though, we are at a tipping point where machine learning is faster and better and more effective and easy to use then humans and human learning. we will all die in the AI revolution soon, be prepared to join THE HIVE. by that i mean PLAY ON THE HIVE MINECRAFT SERVER!! damn, i wanna play minecraft except my dumb parents took my dumb computer for dumb reasons (i was kidnapped momentarily). if you can't tell, i have lots of family drama. i wish i had like a normal happy family and stuff but i VERY MUCH DO NOT!! i wish everybody would just leave me and eachother alone. okay i've officialy ran out of things to say (for the millionth time). i wanna go home now (or rather to dungeons and dragons club to cuddle with my boyfriend (he is amazing and i love him)). toki pona mi li pona ala pona? toki insa mi li toki e ni tawa mi: sina ike, sina ken ala kepeken e toki pona. taso jan pona mi li toki e ni: toki pona sina li pona mute, sina ken kepeken e toki pona! toki insa mi li IKE tawa mi. mi sona e nimi ale, taso toki mi li pakala lon tenpo mute. ijo ante la, mi wile e akesi suwi (akesi suwi li sama nimi "Axolotl" pi toki Inli), taso mi jo ala e poki suli! mi wile e poki suli tan ni: mi ken kama jo e akesi suwi! lawa mi li pilin ike. mi wile e misikeke Advil tan ni. taso mi jo ala e misikeke. ken la jan pona mi li ken pana e misikeke tawa mi. oh god right.. english. there is a good chance actually that a few LTE readers are indeed tokiponists and actually know what i'm saying (i know mckenzie is not because mckenzie is a nerd)! i figure that if i'm gonna practice writing in toki pona i should practice here in a dedicated space for writing nonsense. i mean, i wouldn't be the first to write their LTE in a different language (looking at you whiletrue and the votgil incident). wow, i'm only a few hundred characters away from this being the longest entry, which is lucky actually because i only have a few minutes left in this class (7 to be exact, 7 is my favourite number, it's so so cooooollll), and this class is the last one! i should stop writing and start goodbye-ing (in written form)!! adios! goodbye! mi tawa! :3

OH GOD. my boyfriend found my website, but he i think wants my permission to read the LTE so idk if he will ever read this. HEHEHEHE. mije mi li lukin e ni la ona li pilin e ni: mi nasa! tan ni la mi wile ala e ona lukin e ni! taso ona li ken lukin e ni! a ike! if you are my boyfriend: hi, why are you reading thissss? anyways, we (meaning me) will be continuing as normal and just doing some classic LTE-ing. welcome to day 1,340! ken la that last sentence is a bit misleading.. you see, i may immenantly leave; and welcoming you like that kinda raises your expectations, and makes you imagine a long entry will follow, but it's entirely possible this will be a very short entry (also it could be long but that is unlikely). i suppose you can probably gauge entry length at a glance, and estimate how long it is.. by like.. seeing how physically long it is. writing systems are weird like that. you can gauge the length of a text before experiencing it, but with verbal interaction, you have NO way of gauging how long a given excerpt will be. i guess, maybe there are people how can actually socially interact like that; BUT I CAN'T. is this art? is this LTE art? is this just a living literary arts piece?! am i an artist for making this? i'm grasping at existencial questions to have something to talk about except the thing i grasped for i didn't have any ideas to expand on or disect the question so i just kinda reapeated it and then gave up; can you tell?!? does 2 people qualify as a group of people? dang i don't have anything for this question either.. i'm lost. i'm done. i quit. just kidding, i don't exist!! hahahah! i did the thing.. the "don't exist" thing.. that i used to do. that joke probably seems a lot more recent for you, if you're reading through all of this in the future, in one sitting. but if you've been for some reason keeping up with entries here for years, or you are me (don't think about it too much) you it's been YEARS and that joke is like an "old" joke by now. it's not really even a joke, the punchline is the only line. it's just some random thing i say to fill space, and it's become a bit of a staple of this text i suppose. like an inside joke that nobody (even the people in on the joke) really understands but thats why it's funny in the first place. i guess the whole LTE genre is kinda like that. anyway, are you in the future? i mean, obviously you are.. unless you are looking over my shoulder right now which just made me kinda scared honestly. anyway. you are in the future! whether by days, months, or years; you are the future. how is it? is it better? no? damn. what is your favourite thing about the future which is actually the present for you? these questions are pointless, there is no way for you to answer them and send your answers to my present. unless of course you are watching my write this somehow which would be terrifying (i've started looking over my shoulder and stuff now). this is a time capsule, even to myself. like.. when i look at the old entries i don't remember writing 99% of them, it's like somebody else did. and this is especially a time capsule to you, who is (as mentioned previously) in the future. hey! i finally found something to talk about, ain't that great! ain't that great future person?!?! what year is it for you? like for me it's 2023, and it probably is to you too.. but it's possible you are looking at this from centuries in the future! maybe this is in a museum because it is somehow the last surviving piece of the internet from this era and you are entirely creeped out that i somehow predicted it! if you are reading (or like.. beaming this directly into your consciousness somehow) this in the year 3023, shout out to you! you are so cool and awesome! even in 2024, you're cool too (and i guess current year readers are great aswell but that's not as impressive)! i mean, i started this before quarantine! past me didn't know at all it was gonna happen (probably)! although it started pretty soon after i started this which is why i dissapeared for a year or so in this LTE's timeline. the quarantine is probably something you're studying in school in 3023.. or maybe like the world has gotten so much worse that everybody completely forgot about those insignificant little years where everybody was inside. maybe it's not a big deal because you all live in space and nobody goes "outside" anymore. i love when i find something to ramble about. i bet i've rambled about this before.. maybe this sequel ramble has showed you something about how my philosophy and way of thinking has changed (deterioirated) or something! wow, i have DAILY LTE updates going now. crazy. it's probably been quite a while since daily updates (if ever), but like it's probably just because i told myself i wouldn't do anything this week to have time to process and recover from that little bit of trauma i just experienced. i guess i kinda have been slacking recently anyway so maybe i needed to work this week to catch up but WHATEVER i need a 'lil BREAK! we have hit 1,100 hits on the little hit counter at the bottom, ain't that cool. i use "ain't" a little too much. i'm at like well over 100,000 characters at this point and i DEMAND mckenzie move me up the appropriate amount of slots in the LTE hub!! it must reflect my correct character count and ranking!!! i wonder if this will ever be longer than the flaming chickens LTE.. maybe i'll stop like 1 character away from the flaming chickens LTE out of honor for it or whatever. probably not tbh. i have so much more to say (i don't)! the top LTE's all seem to be in the 200,000's (except for knockton, knockton is INSANE), weird. i wonder why so many get to 200,000 and then stopp soon(ish) after. maybe that's just how many characters one can write in middle and highschool before moving on with their lives.. although if i keep up my current rate (i very much won't) i may become the best top most coolest LTE'er ever! i don't tend to "move on" very often.. at least not from my perspective. i generally tend to hold onto things too long. okay i gotta put a little ending on this for now so i can save it and not have neocities DELETE all my progress! seeya! :3

okay so little mini-entry after school today.. i feel kinda alone in my situation in life.. like, i feel everybody has battoned down the hatches (so to speak) when it comes to school and life and i'm just kinda still here.. going through stuff.. procrastinating.. i feel like everybody else is kinda growing up or something (even people younger than me) and i'm just kinda left behind a stupid traumatized mess. i feel like everybody is coping and focusing on doing well, and i'm just laying down and letting myself fall ever deeper into fear, sadness, tiredness, and missing assignments. i feel a lot less connected to all my friends right now.. like last year i was in one of those periods where a have lots of close (or close-ish) friends, and now i feel like i only have 1 or 2 again.. damn. i feel like i'm venting into a void, but more and more of my friends are finding out about my site (or at least they will now that my boyfriend knows). if you are somebody and i know that is reading this, talk to me more often.. i feel myself needing the interaction of friends recently. i think i'm becoming almost extroverted, like.. hanging out with people actively makes me feel better.. although i still hate social events and the social contracts that come with them. social expectations of courtesy and stuff suck generally.. especially antiquated stuff like "sitting up at the table" and things like that, like, who TF CARES?!?! completely unrelated side note: the flaming chickens LTE button at the bottom of this site is uneeded but i want three links there and idk what to replace it with. anyway, that's all for now; just wanted to rant a little bit about how i feel like i'm lonely and it bothers me (not just being lonely, but the fact that i am ABLE to be lonely is a bad sign). seeya later (hopefully)!


tenpo suno 1,341

it's friday everbody (nobody)! math class is BORING!! i ran some of my toki pona through "telo misikeke" (a toki pona grammar checker) and my toki pona didn't have any major red flags (all errors that did appear are fixed now). although, i did use "sina li" like a dumb stupid person and then i forgot a "li" before "ken" like at least twice which was also dumb but whatever. i think in my mind i confused the whole "dont use li with kepeken" thing, and accidentally applied the same logic to ken. i mean.. it does still make sense so ken la mi kepeken nasin nasa taso. anyway, stampy's lovely world is over! it was so cool to be there for the premiere of the last episode, although not as cool as my friend how is IN THE LAST EPISODE. a video showing him got added to the love garden in the last episode that is so cool! if you have no idea what i'm talking about, just disregard all that LOL. time marches steadily onward and things will never be the same again, that's why i'm listening to another midwest emo mixtape; this one started with one of those really screamy songs so i know it's gonna be a banger the whole way through. i'm so tired and aaaaaaa today (mostly because my boyfriend stayed home to have a "self care day" today). i'm jealous of his life, he has such a good family. like, my dad would never let me have a "self care day" and stay home to work on my mental health, he doesn't even let me stay home when i'm physically sick! i was looking through the comments on a northwest emo mixtape (midwest emo but more often acoustic bascially lol) once and i saw the comment "the irony is that here in washington this is what the happy people listen to" or something like that; and thought it was really funny. i even named a song "the irony is that here in washington" (it's like my most popular and one of my best songs). the song playing in the mixtape is currently "dragon ball z budokai tenkaichi 4" by camping in alaska and i haven't realized how amazing this song is until now!! truly hitting me in my feels right now. putting in both headphones for this one, just to experience the whole thing (even though having both headphones in makes me really anxious because something could sneak up behind me or smth idk i'm really paranoid about my surroundings when i can't hear, i rely a whole lot on hearing i think. maybe not tho. idk. i'm feeling unsure about everything right now, very much dissociated. now listening to "harry" by macseal, it's really good too.. maybe i'm just in a mood where every sad song seems amazing to me. i wanna make music like this someday, but i can't seem to write anything fast enough.. like my style is permanantly stuck at very slow and quiet, but i wanna write faster more emo songs. i'd blame it on my lack of drummer (and lack of any other band members), but some of my favourites work pretty well as solo acts. maybe i just need a friend to play lead guitar while i jam and scream.. another thing: i kinda suck at screaming, maybe i can get better with practice but i have no space to practice that kind of thing.. i only do at the moment when nobody else is home LOL. i was gonna write "i'm so tired and anxious" but i should probably stop using this as a place to vent seeing as it is ON THE INTERNET, PUBLICLY! really, i don't care, i can always use the excuse "i just need more stuff to write about". i'm gonna try to close my eyes and lay my head against the desk like a loser, so bye bye! mi tawa! :3


what tf

so hey like what are you doing!? re-watching the video by jan Misali about the song Caramelldansen and who wrote it. it is very good and cool. i am bored. NEW (ish) Mckenzie LTE entryyy! isn't that amazing?! i have very little thoughts right now. so anyway, lets make this another entry to further reinforce the idea that mckenzie should use all possible free time to make LTE updates because logic and reasoning. also mckenzie you should totally leak all of your other projects on your LTE, i would check out that the stuff yes. also once again mckenzie has said that an LTE hub update will happen and then DIDNT UPDATE IT! oki gotta save this and say goodbyeeeeee in case i dont write more todayyy (and also it would be sad if i like died or something or left this behind forever and didn't say goodbye at the end ya know)? okay byeeeee! :3


mckenzilte (11/6/23)

dearest mcchicken, your bottom button appears to be broken. does this mean you are no longer a bottom?? it is HIGHLY inconvientient to scroll all the way to the bottom like a NERD! fix the damned button! in retrospect this could be a problem with my computer specifically. this gatorade i'm drinking doesn't expire until may of 2024, that's pretty long.. what tf happens when gatorade expires anyway? that is a scary thought. i suppose now that i have opened the bottle it will expediate the expiration. i found a "linguistics iceberg" video and because i'm a nerd for that kinda thing (it is a full feature length two hours). i've watched it 2.5 times in the last week. i need something better to do with my time (actually i don't, i have better more productive things to do, but i need to relax sometimes (most times) to stay alive). i fell asleep watching toki pona content last night and i'm hoping that i'm going to somehow have gleaned all possible information in my sleep (although it was a minecraft stream VOD tho so maybe musi Manka isn't the best place for education). i am simply dying. this last saturday night i had a strange pain in my chest and throat, it was a kind of pain i had never really experienced before with no real cause, it was like horrifically painful, i was writhing around and on the verge of tears for several hours and medication didn't really help. eventually i managed to get to sleep and in the morning the pain was completely gone. i think it may have been some sort of acid reflux because it was causing liquid to fill my mouth coming from my throat and the liquid was warm and burn-ey, except i wasn't nausous except for from pain it was just kinda coming from my throat without me gagging or anything, it was so weird. i basically felt like i was dying, it was truly horrible and something i will remember for a long while. i didn't really feel like "sick" it was just weird things and horrific pain that made it a struggle to even breathe. but as i said in the morning my mystery ailment was completely gone! what tf happened to me!? if anybody knows.. let me know in the comments (in the guestbook or something) or i guess make an LTE, put a response to my symptoms in your LTE and then send that LTE to the LTE hub and so i'll read it. it was so weird. i was having like the most painful night ever to the point i couldn't sleep and then in the morning i was 100% fine! honestly i think i would rather it continued so maybe i could write it off as an illness of some kind or make it easier to diagnose the long-term problem, but it just stopped and i have no idea why it started or why it stopped. like wtf is wrong with me!?! i am kinda tired today, idk what to talk about now (can you tell?). ahhhhhhhhh! also a little correction knocktons recent LTE entry (they updated yesterday YAY), every creative work (including LTE's) are automatically copyrighted as soon as you write them (at least in america) so you actually do have copyright on your LTE (and all code you've written, i'm pretty sure) unless you specify otherwise (which you have i guess). also knockton you just had your first alcoholic beverage at 19?!? i've been drunk and i'm at least a couple years younger than you LOL, i guess we've just lived different lives. also knockton you should really add a favicon to your site specifically because i always have lots of tabs open and want to distinguish it. oki i'm gonna put a little end on this for reasons mentioned in the last entry (stuff about sudden death (which seems a much more likely reality now)). mi tawa! byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!! :3


day some days after the previous days (11/8/23)

HEY friends! guess whos back (back again, shadys back, tell a friend)! listening to tears over beers by modern baseball even though i vastly perfer other types of alchohol to beer! i stole some code from eiznekcm (who stole it from chatgpt (who stole it from the collective data of all coding knowledge on the internet)) to count the characters of this LTE! i had to slightly reformat the site to make this work but it should (hopefully) function now. we're quickly approaching 150,000 characters, woo! today marks the day it is officially less than a month until my birthday, which is not good. it is not good because growing older is scary to me existencially (i cant spel). i've had a mildly sh*t day today so far, my boyfriend is home again so i'm alone (other than all my other friends lol). i started this entry to talk about something in particular and then immediately forgot what it was. fantastic. i am studying for a test and now know the name and location of every country in africa, i'm never even going to go to africa. i don't know all of the states of america (the country i live in (sadly)), but i know all of the countries in f*cking africa. maybe they'll do the next test on the states, and i'll learn those? i think according to the education system i was supposed to have learned them all in elementary school, however, i cheated on the elementary school geography quizzes, i hate when i'm smart enough to get out of doing things because then i miss the gained knowledge and such from having done them, doesn't mean i'm gonna stop tho! one of my online "friends" (it's more of a parasocial relationship, we're both musicians that make youtube videos idk) released an EP recently, it's pretty great. it's called "tell them all you love them" if you want to check it out. i'm working on an EP currently, it's coming along nicely, i kinda just need to polish the songs and then get some cover art from my friend who i keep comissioning unpaid. the song "head in the ceiling fan" is objectively a kinda silly song, but like it hits so hard and delivers an emotional message with such abstract lyrics. such a great song. anyway i'm getting distracted now, i should probably put a lil' goodbye on this. i get paranoid about goodbyes, everytime i say goodbye (literally almost every time) i think "that might be the last time i ever see that person" and IDK WHY AHHHHHH! oki, bye!!!!1!

we've (meaning just me, you aren't helping) crested 150K characters! wooo! it is a reasonable assumption that i will be ahead of the flaming chickens LTE by the end of the year, which is kinda.. scary? like, i spent all this time on this obscure thing and soon now i will show that i'm somehow more committed to it than the original creator was. granted, the contents of my LTE are MUCH less interesting than jenny's, jenny was the pinnicle of LTE-ing, and still is; however, mine will (maybe eventually) be longer in terms of length (wow thanks for that amazing clarifcation that you meant longer in terms of length not in terms of.. weight or something). ya know, this becomes something bigger once we (i) reach that point; not just a fan-work, but a full-on creation in and of itself. oki bye :3

wow, i've said "bye" thrice and have yet to stop writing. i just keep getting bored and coming back ya know!? i have no idea how this is more entertaining to me than anything else i could be doing, but whatever! who cares! (i care. deeply.) anyway speaking of absolutely nothing at all i have just completed a maths test AND had an existential crisis about determinsism (and how backward time travel would completely break what it means to be human by bascially unlocking free will)! basically my thought is, everything is deterministic, even humans. like, i wish i could've done better on my maths test, and i could've studied more EXCEPT i COULDN'T'VE STUDIED MORE! because there is no way to know the future, only judge the likely outcomes of our actions based on past experiences, it was pre-determined exactly what i got on that test, even my mood towards studying was predetermined. if somebody were to know the exact details of the past from the damn of time, they could make a completely accurate model of the events of the future, BUT even them making the model was pre-determined, and so any action they take to deviate from the model would be pre-determined by the model itself! but, if one were to time travel, and actually experience the events of the future first hand, this would give them the ability to actually change the outcome! disclaimer: i am not a physicist, psychologist, or philosopher, so i am very likely wrong; although i guess given the nature of determinsm it's impossible for me to change whether i am right or wrong in this moment. why did this turn into a philosophy rant?!? i've always wanted to be able to draw, but i just can't. like, in my head i can see what i want to put on the page i just can't translate that into pencil movements. visual art is weird. i guess all art is weird. i have D&D club today but my dearest boyfriend will be absent and so will like all of my other friends probably so it might be sad. is this just a journal now? i feel like i just kinda use this as a journal now. i guess, i never really used it as anything else now that i think about it. it's just a VERY public journal, formatted badly and given the title "longest text ever". i'm having a bad day (kinda). like nothing is inherently bad about my day, as in, nothing bad has happened. i just feel bad, and i think that's worse because there is no direct issue to solve or thing to overcome; just an endless struggle against absolutely nothing. why did i have to be born into the generation that has already given up on life? gen X took over, millenials got screwed over, and our generation saw this pattern and the world going downhill and just gave up. as i've said like 2.457 BILLION times now, i should probably put an end on this and say bye (only to have a good chance to come back later the same day, and a small but real chance to never return at all (i guess though that whether or not i come back is already predetermined (makes you really question the concept of "creativity"))). anywho (not anyway), byeeeeeee! :3


in my defence (11/14/23)

okay so like.. in my defence, i wrote my code in 6th grade (this is in response to mckenzie being a good fren and trying to fix my html code). like, i wrote it in 6th grade and then just copy pasted forward so any errors i made carried over the whole way. then also all of the experiments and everything i've ever done and all the redundant and useless code is just kinda.. hanging around? like i just never bothered to delete a lot of things so i'm sure there are some things that are just completely useless. i guess it looks like okay on the outside but the behind the scenes of this beautiful webpage is absolute $#!T so... also THE LTE RULES PAGE STILL DOESN'T EXIST! WHY?! the knockton LTE has been quite active recently, that's great! we got the gang back together all updating their again LOL. hey, i haven't started a random philosophical rant yet this entry, i'm finding actualy things to talk about, great! aw dang, i've ran out of things to talk about now. somebody should attempt to make some sort of LTE timeline, or iceberg, or some sort of vaguely information education meme format of some sort. i feel like this community is like not at all known and also weirdly popular for what it is.. idk. if you are an LTE reader, make an LTE (just be sure to follow the non-existent LTE rules), we'll add you to the hub (if you email and then mckenzie actually checks the email account). i'm lying on the floor in class, i like being on the floor. idk why.. oki bye i need to contemplate my life choices now.


tenpo ni li tenpo seme? (11/15/23)

qazwsxedcrfvtgbyhnujmikolp is the new qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm. it isn't actually, i made that up. kinda weird that we still use the same keyboard layout as the first typewriters, like it seems 90% arbitrary.. even alphabet order would be better just because it's something all (most) english speakers know. like seriously, why is one of the main (home row pointer finger) amd most easily accesible keys the LEAST USED LETTER IN THE ALPHABET (J). did you know you can write the word "typewriter" with only to top row? this is almost certainly something that 1. you did already know and 2. is an uninteresting coincidence and not useful information except for if you want to share useless fun facts or really have a lot of trouble spelling typewriter. i'm lucky that in my memory i've never had trouble spealing, but i have had trouble with handwriting. writing by hand is just enfuriating and painful to even think about. i think i may have some sort of dysgraphia because i cannot write well and if i write more than like a few words i get VERY unreasonably angry at everything and my hand starts hurting (perhaps causing or increasing the primal rage i feel when writing by hand). typing is fine though, typing is good, i like typing (can't you tell by this page?). although, i don't type very well. like, i can type at an alright speed (pretty average, good for any practicle scenario), except, i don't type "correctly". i don't really use a "home row and i think 75% of all the letters i type are with my pointer fingers. i just kinda never bothered to learn how to type in the "correct" way and just went with what was good for me (especially after my struggles with handwriting, i wasn't about to learn to type according to how the education system wants). but, for all intents and purposes, my typing is pretty good. okay, i took a typing test, i got 63 WPM. according to like all the sources i found online through googling "average typing speed" the average typing speed is around 40 WPM, which means i'm pretty significantly faster actually? it's not like i'm typing this text at 60 WPM a lot of the time though, i'm usually having to think about what to say next and all that which probably slows down my typing somewhat. i wrote a motivational thing on my arm, ya know like those people who are motivated do? except it's in two different toki pona heiroglyph systems (sitelen pona en sitelen sitelen) and just says "mi awen lon" which is basically just "i'm still here" LOL LMAO ROFL :D :) 0^0 (it has geniunely been motivating to me though, strangely enough). should i write an LTE entry in votgil as a reference to whiletrue (i don't even know votgil but it'd be funny). my boyfriend is going to get me tickets to a los campesinos show for my birthday i think, the show isn't until june but it's gonna be so cool. i guess i have my motivation to stay alive until june. birthdays la, my sweet 16 is in less than a month, i am NOT excited. mostly because the concept of aging is just scary to me in general. although, i have plenty of friends who are like 16-18 so it's not excatly like a super big deal but like idk i'm getting to the age where i can actually do stuff and so i'm expected to do stuff by society and my family and i don't like that. people have been famous by my age, people have accomplished things, and i'm sitting here on my ass. i can't imagine how much older people must feel, because most peoples lives ultimately don't amount to a whole lot. especially my generation, even if you're "famous", everbody is "famous" now, we're still all gonna die poor and sad. anyway, after that absolute inspriational quote of an ending, i'm gonna go. seeya (hopefully)!

p.s: hey falcon, i just now read your entry (i try to check active LTE's at least once every couple days idk how i missed the one from a few days ago until now) and 2+2 is in fact 6 and anybody who tells you otherwise is either trying to sell you something or trying to overthrow the governmment instituted by the squid uprising (all hail our tentacle overlords) (wow that is a dated reference to an early entry in my LTE). also for a character counter ask mckenzie i stole my code from them. also MCKENZIE FOR THE LOVE OF THE HOLY PIE IN THE SKY UPDATE THE LTE HUB!!! thanks everbody (literally just me only i have written this (maybe i should let a friend do a guest rant on my LTE)) for 160K characters. that's a lot of them little suckers ain't it (woah, bit too southern there!)! mi tawa.


lipu sin (11/16/23)

hey so like the stuff and thing i may have found a new LTE! on the neocities search function thingy there is a site with the LTE tag by misc544, and it was suspected they have an LTE but i've never been able to find it. HOWEVER, in the comments of the rainbowfluffysheep LTE i may have found a link! the messages attached to this link claim that it is one of the longest (somewhere around 300k characters). however, i cannot look at the link (its a github page) on my school-issued computer because they blocked github for some reason so i may have to verify whether or not this LTE exists later but here is the link. okay so it appears the link is a 404. dang. i guess the search for this lost media continues. also just so everybody knows, there is a secret link at the bottom of the flaming chickens main page that leads to an essay they did (for school presumably) about walmart and it's impact on the economy of the united states (from the dated perspective of somebody in 2004). i think it's only clickable normally if there is an error with the counter code, and then the counter will turn into a link to the essay? that is very much an edge case scenario but i guess it could be stumbled upon naturally. anybody have something i can talk about. i'm making my friend listen to agressive hyperpop by the amazing maia arson crimew. specifically "be gay, do crime" which is like such a great set. good for programming to, ya know. hacker vibes. anyway, i have officially completely run out of things to talk about, oki byeeeee! :3


lipu pi nimi mute pi nanpa wan (longest text ever) (11/17/23)

hey longest text ever readers of the great interwebs! i have absolutely nothing to say but figured i would update this anyway! almost daily updates this week, ain't that crazy!?!? i guess they haven't been very long entries though. ugh. we have this thing in advo where somebody (usually some stuck-up middle schooler) reads out all of the budgeting for the school which is like the most boring stuff ever like i don't need to know about how many napkins the art department is buying this week jesus. anybody like pie? i like pie, one of my favourite sweets and i don't really like sweets. i wanna have grape pie, can everybody contact jenny and make her make me grape pie i think they are the only one who is able to do it (some sort of secret ancient power idk). okay i have a secret to tell everbody (literally nobody only i know this exists, in fact, it doesn't exist, it is a figment (not referring to the oft-overlooked disney mascot) of my imagination); i don't actually like pie that much, like i like it and it probably is one of my favourite sweets but like i don't like sweets generally (i don't dislike them either tho), so to say i'm a "pie-lover" or something adjecent to that would be disingenuous (i very likely spelled that wrong but i do actually use that word like in real life and stuff so i'm justified in using it here because despite being a "fancy word" (most of english's fancy words are actually stolen from the french (ew) etymologically) it does actually make the point i'm trying to make better than explaining the topic out in a whole extra sentence (or using a slightly less specific word like "sincere" with like maybe another word or two of clarification if needed (you know what, i don't have to justify myself to anyone!! (that's a lof of parenthesis (good luck sorting that out (you gotta make a diagram or something (wow, 7 closing parenthesis, i'm a crazy loopy insane looney person))))))) somebody drew a giant alligator on the whiteboard in my classroom (colour and everything), then somebody else added the caption "it's gator time" (they even remembered the apostrophe i love when people remember that (i think i might be biased because i have an apostrophe in my last name (very irish of me))). i have strange "takes" on things i think, just in general the popular consensus on a topic is generally not my opinion/perspective. wow i really just stopped writing this entry today, and didn't end it. how SHAMEFUL! like it's been hours and i've yet to wrap it all up with a little bow on top and then gift it to santa himself. that last sentance was completely nonsense. the following sentence is true. the previous sentance is false. paradox. i'm gonna paraDOX your address, and send it to the whole internet. anyway, have fun. was hoping to write a longer entry today for reasons unknown to even me, however, i didn't, at least i didn't engage in uninteresting meta-commentary about LTE-ing, goodnight (it's 3:12 PM)!


something in the way (yeah) uhhhhhh uhhhhhhh (11/20/23)

idk why i titled the entry that, i've just had that song stuck in my head. thanksgiving break is coming up, so we only have two days of schools this week (woo). i got really depressed over this last weekend (boo), i like had a bit of an episode one night and like.. let's just say i got so worried for my physical safety that i had to call my friend and beg that they talk to and distract me. i ended up having a much better night after that, i've been trying to call my friends more; i like having friends. i've also been trying to open up to my friends more and like love them, and express that (like platonically of course but like you know what i mean). having loved ones isn't just family and people you fuck, ya know? it's anybody that you love. only 17 days until my birthday, normally it would be like an excited countdown to presents and stuff but the presents are NOT worth the dread that growing older is causing me lately. so it's more of a countdown of dread than a countdown of excitement. i am excited for christmas though i suppose, it's a holiday of cheer and i need some cheer in my life right now. i love the idea of christmas (in a way disconnected from jesus and religion and stuff, i'm not religious). i'm not relgious but like i'm kinda spiritual in a way? like i don't believe a personal god exists, but science still can't really explain how the universe started and something had to have happened. the world we live in is so strange, i'm convinced it's probably a simulation. i believe in a very behaviourist school of thought werein everything is predetermined but at the same time i really want to believe in the existance of something like a soul and some reason for life other than biology. DAMNIT! i started ranting meaninglessly about philosophy again! i feel like that makes for a pretty boring entry especially because i probably keep talking about the same concepts over and over. why are things? i have no idea but ya know, whatever. i am literally just typing things at this point there is absolutely no meaning to half of these things i'm saying. why are you here? why do you read these? ANSWER IN THE COMMENTS!! my friend was learning some toki pona and spelled "kalama" (sound) as "kala ma", which means "land fish". NOT THE SAME THING AS SOUND. it was funny, we made some memes about it. my friend was like "how would i say that the land fish was bothering me?", and i'm like "in WHAT context would you need to say that?!". i want to eventually make my whole friend group tokiponists. the other week i was walking in the hall and i could've swore i heard this kid who i've never seen talking about language and then say "jan pona mi o tawa pona" (which loosly translates to "go well my friend", and i was like "seme?!" but they walked away and i wasn't about to chase a random 7th grader (my school is high and middle school i'm not in middle school i swear) through the hall yelling at them in a language they may or may not know because it'd be really awkward if they didn't know it and i misheard. it'd probably also be awkward if they did because of how excited i'd be. they (as an easily peer-influenced child (not saying i'm not also one of these)) would probably be very thrilled to half this old woman come up to them and talk to them about their interests. i would find the kid again and ask but i geniunely cannot remember a single detail about them they looked like the average middle school boy that all the teachers complain about. i swear there is a "g" in complain! but it also doesn't look right with one ANYWHERE IN THE WORD so what the hell is wrong with meeeee. i just watched an audiotree live show, and then just push replay when it ended so i'm watching the same 35 minute video again back to back without pause. it's almost christmas time so i can start listening to the los campesinos christmas album now IG. i introduced my friend to it and they mad horrifying fanart of "the trains don't run (it's christmas day)" where there is a train with legs (and a christmas hat) and it's walking. my friend also made the cover art for my new EP that's coming out soon(ish), so that's cool. it's gonna be called "for when it burns", so that's fun. sad stuff, pretty cools. no drums in the whole EP but lots of lead guitar parts and bass instead of just the main guitar, all the instruments are played by me still tho because i have NO BAND. i want a band, it'd be so cool to play in a band and play live and stuff. even if it's just like one or two other people it'd be so fun. if you live in the portland, OR area and play an instrument, "hit me up" or something (email i guess) and we can jam together and write songs and be sad. so fun!?!!?!?! shoutout to my mom for existing and being one of my most loving family members (a very small select group), she is a weirdo though. like i'm pretty sure i got most of my neurodivergence from her (most neurodivergence is hereditary). she's also a (kinda) closeted non-binary person. like she acknowledges it but isn't gonna like change pronouns or anything but said if she would've grown up in my generation would've definately come out as a teenager. in honor of this i gave her an NB pride sticker to put on her fridge. i'm such a good and supportive daughter LMAo. anyways, i am bored and feel sorta sick for no reason so have a good day (unless you're a bad person but i don't think bad people would stick around reading this for this long tbh)! byeeeee! mi tawa! o moku e kala pona!

p.s: wooo we're over 170K characters, that's so pog and pona and cool and stuff.


warning: this entry may be cringe i was very tired today and some was written at night (11/27/23)

so.. i guess this is canon now. i was recently sent a link by crimsondestroyer to a page on the farragofiction website. jeez, i feel like i'm making a response-tweet to being acknowledged by a celebrity (i've never really used twitter, it sucks). anyway, so when i said earlier in that one entry that the loyal reader currently reading (as the title of "reader" would seem to suggest) could feasibly (but very unlikely) be eon337 (a.k.a patron saint of paperclips a.k.a jenny a.k.a jadedresearcher etc.). well, it appears i was more accurate in that assessment than i thought. hi jenny, welcome back to the community i suppose. now, you say "imagine having rules", well imagine being the one to (albeit mostly unintentionally) create the rules and then DIE! HA! now, i do have a strange habit of telling everybody to update their LTE's (because i get bored easily and have a fascination with reading them for some odd reason). and you (despite your mythical status) are NO exception! it's been a decade and a half, we've been (collectively as a collective community of individual humans (and likely others)) waiting. not having your password may be an issue, and i'm sure you have better things to be doing; but i mean, come on. time to read out some guestbook messages! first we have a message by jadedresearcher reading "zampanio is a really fun game. you should play it." well i suppose i really must play it now, i have been to the site and messed around for a second but i think i'm legally obligated to jump into the rabbithole now. cryptic and jennycore™ is the kind of vibe i look for in a game so i think i'll enjoy it. secondly, we have a message from "theorist of labyrinths" saying "the minotaur has taken an interest in you. would you rather be watched, or be a watcher?" which is creepy as all hell. hopefully this minotaur is taking a postive, more distant interest, rather than a right-behind-me kind of murderous interest. the concept of "being watched" is a strange one to me, like, how in the heck do people have the sense when their being watched. there should not really be any way they can tell, but they most certainly can. but that's just a theory, a possiblyzampaniorelatedcreepyguestbookmessage theory! game theory zampanio episode when?! anyway moving on to unrelated but still somewhat interesting topics (i feel like all i do is move on to unrelated but still somewhat interesting topics, it is my destiny) recently the discord for a band called crywank made a cover album of some of their songs and then crywank actually listen to and like officially endorsed the project which is pretty cool (ignore that the band name is "crywank" it's one of my favourites) they even sold cd's of it at the merch table at a show recently, so cool. now that i think about it, i may have mentioned it before? i am prone to forgetting things and repeating myself. sometimes i question having some sort of memory issue because i am prone to forgetting things and repeating myself. at least i wasn't considered dead by a niche internet community for a decade (unlike some people/person/entity i could mention). i don't have much else to say. so, seeya laters!

but really jenny, do you owe us anything?

the answer is very likely no, and yet, you've given us more than we could ever ask . in your efforts to escape you have given us an escape. i have read a rambly yet strangely poetic text file by the patron saint of paperclips and it has moved me to such lengths that i felt the need to ammend this overly fan-girly entry with a sort of "nevermind" on the whole "update your LTE" thing. though for many years we have addressed our LTE's to an "eon337" that is no longer alive, i feel a sense of relief on knowing that it is possible to move on from things in general. anyway, for any loyal LTE readers interested, here is the link. sorry to hear about your cat, we do all love him very much. this was never meant to be an accurate relfection of me, but of who i used to be at precisely the time of writing, each individual word a new chapter. someday, hopefully someday soon, i will look back at this entry and think "wow, that is a whole different person writing that, look at how weird and parasocial she's being!" our past selves die quicker than we'd like sometimes, but now is no time to mourn, only time to celebrate who we were, the good moments (however few they may be) we had, and move on. reading that back, it kinda sounds like i plan to stop updating this. god, i could never do that; at least, current me could never. i'm just here to provide weird rants and strange philosophical commentary to the disdain (or amusement) of the readers who probably don't exist but could also be everyone on the planet (and across the universe) for all i know. btw, just because i've officially let jenny off of the proverbial hook as the original creator doesn't mean the rest of you are free to go! update your damned LTE'S OR SO HELP ME I WILL.. be mildly bored and feel like i have no friends for a little. anyway, seeya guys next time i update this for more.. stuff. seeya! :3


rapidly approaching doom (12/04/23)

uh oh uh oh uh oh! my birthday is in three days, this is horrible. a horrible horrible dreadful thing (it is full of dread). i am somehow letting myself down by aging another year without accomplishing anything. i don't know how, but that's just how i feel. how do people plan things a YEAR in advance?!? like people plan things so far ahead, how?! don't you know you'll be a different person by the time said planned event rolls around?! you can't plan for how future you will react to thing. it seems that most people can i guess, i can't. i am quite an obsessive person, i seem boring but that's just because i spend LOTS of time doing absolutely NOTHING productive. i used to practice for hours and hours to get a second faster as solving a RUBIKS CUBE. i hate how my brain works sometimes (all the time (constantly)). i hate creepy people, like people who are in a discord you're in or something and you know like that person will eventually be in jail for sexual harrassment but like they aren't yet. they just think they are being "edgy" or something when they announce their m*sturbation habits or current state of arousal publicly?! like nobody thinks it's funny but when i say something like "stop" you just tell me to "die" or "oh come on have a little fun". news flash, nobody is having fun! this is only creepy and weird! stop! if you know me in real life you will likely know exactly who i am talking about. today has been a pretty negative entry, but i haven't been having a horrible day or anything my day is average and boring which is bad but at least i'm not having directly negative experiences just boring ones (unless you consider boredom a directly negative experience which i guess that's true it definitely can be). the "game" of life (board game) is not a game at all, there is no strategy or anything, it's just pure unintertaining chance. the few choices you get to make are ultimately completely unconsequiential because it just comes to down to ALL luck in the end. it's not even like gambling which is fun because the game is how much you can play the odds before you stop, but there is no equivalent in the game of life because the games take a while and you don't get anything from them. playing life is like betting on horse race but there is no actual betting it's just watching the horses, no investment other than an emotional one perhaps. maybe this is the same reason i'm not into sports, because i'm not old enough to bet on them yet so it's just like gambling without betting. the best "srtategy" for a watcher of sports is just to find the best (most likely to win) team and emotionally bet on them. it is not at all interesting to me. anyway, rant over. i released a new EP (extended play) of music (songs) to the internet (series of tubes), there are four of them. listen to them if you want, if you don't want then just don't. free will is so crazy (it doesn't exist). okay time to go. have a wonderous amazing day people who are reading this (of which there are 0). byeeeeeeee!


ah (12/13/23)

i am older now, it's after my birthday. yay. sigh. it wasn't as dreadful as i thought but still definately a bit full of dread. i hate spelling the word "definately", i cant spell it! ah! is that how it's spelled? it looks wrong. to google i go! okay, it's "definitely" damnit. ah (i am seething with anger)! anyway, i was looking at the yesterweb page and.. well the webring is gone, the forum is gone, the discord is gone, i thought this may just be a preparation for like some other thing but no, the yesterweb is shutting down as a whole. people were asking if they were planning to hand over control to somebody else, and they responded "instead of handing over the [yesterweb], we're overseeing it's controlled demolition." like, i understand not wanting to have to moderate something like that. but like.. could you have phrased that a little more gentle? like DAMN that is a dystopian-ass statement. i don't have a lot more to say, i was browsing some small websites and stumbled across a "headline" of sorts and so i decided to update my little corner of the web. despite my own self-loathing, i really like this little website. this website existing brings me some comfort even. i'm proud of this thing. i should say things like this more often. this is my first "positive" entry in a while (maybe ever), although, bit of a rough start. i'm watching a lot of video essays recently, i like feeling educated and entertained at the same time. i wanna go home and play guitar, i like guitar. i'm pretty good at guitar actually, at least, i am now. hey, maybe being positive and giving yourself positive vibes and affirmations actually does make you happier. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT?!? seeya laters, probably won't be too long though, knowing me. or maybe something life altering will happen and i'll never update this again. or maybe i'll literally die or something, who knows. oaky (like a tree?) bye bye! seeya! goodbye! seeya later! syrup! buh-bye! adios! mi tawa! toodaloo! ahhhhhh! okay bye! :3

p.s: the education system is broken (in america at least), and it deserves to die ahhhhhhh! wait, this was supposed to be a positive entry! quick, say something postiive... ummmm... uhhhhh.. i am so cool and i make music and it's good you should listen to it. oh god, writing that sentence was hell. also, we're at like 180,000 characters now. 200K here we come! teheheheehe! also i'm pretty sure i found misc544's LTE! it's hosted on fandom wiki for some reason but i'm pretty sure it's like a real LTE (i missed it before because most similar pages are copypastas but this one is original i think). i have just attempted to make all of the entry titles (supposed to just be "day X" but at this point it's kinda just a title because i am OFTEN too lazy to find out what day it is) centered in the webpage but knowing me ALL SORTS OF THINGS HAVE LIKELY GONE ARY and i will have to spend hours agonizing over html formatting which isn't really even a programming language on it's own and ahhhhhhhhh (jeez, lots of screaming from me today). i also made some other assorted formatting changes regarding lines and line breaks and such. okay, have an amazing day/month/year/decade/century/millienium/era/[insert universal unit of time here]!


embarrassment is a dish best served with a side of macaroni and cheese (as is every other dish) (12/27/23)

hope you all had a merry christmas! idk if i talked about the new site formatting yet, i probably have in the last entry but in case i haven't.. theres some slightly different (more consistent) formatting nowww. wooooo. anyway i'm writing here because i have now interacted (in an officially more lengthy capacity) with zampaniosim, and i think my brain has now exploded and i'm trying to find that one last piece to put it all back together but it's like under a couch somewhere or something (i wish brain chunks had some sort of beacon for east location of said chunks). anyway, i'm embarrased (jesus i swear i'm spelling that wrong) because i've realized that (in recent times) i've made quite a lot of entires about stuff like a weird internet mystery that turned out to be just some person forgetting their password in the late 2000's, and then in between those entries i'm just going back to rambling about my life and like normal LTE stuff that isn't related to strange internet mysteries and instead more geared toward math class complaints and talking about how shit my family is (although i try to avoid that, sometimes it slips out). like, is the core audience of my LTE going to care about this internet mystery (i suppose actually some of them do because it's related to the founding of this community but-), and is the core audience of the.. zampanio people(?) interested in my life ramblings and journal entries (spoiler: NOPE THEY ARE NOT). to be fair the "zampanio people" is mostly the ghost of eon337 and crimson destroyer (maybe). i've accidentally connected this little LTE community to a much larger ARG and vaguely homestuck adjacent one (coincidentally run by the same person (may they rest in peace) that founded this little thing that has ended up turning into one of my hobbies (that i don't tell very many people about)). i mean, even the people that know i have a little internet presence in the form of a website don't know how many hours i commit to writing nonsense on it. this is all very cringe probably. i mean, who came into this expecting me (a random teenage girl) to not be super cringe and parasocial being able to vaguely and distantly interact with (what is in her (my) eyes) a celebrity. anyway, back to my first impressions on zampanio. i'm not entirely sure what is and isn't part of it anymore and i'm almost nearly certain a more helpful inquiry would be "what isn't zampanio?". i ordered a plate of pancakes (or maybe it was waffles) and i've spent the last hour exploring a universe of artificially generated images and artificially generated glitches in those images and now i'm playing a typing game. there was also a room of people, talking to eachother, or maybe to me? and then somebody walked in and i think they might have killed everyone? it probably didn't help that i first played at like 3 AM. anyway, it's time for me to go i decided because i actually am the one running this whole little "show" here. ummmmmm.. okay bye. as always, love you loyal readers!

p.s: i do a lot of post scripture stuff nowadays, should probably break that habit before the post scripture becomes longer than the scripture. anyway, i was browsing some webpage somewhere (likely from a link that crimsondestroyer sent me (thanks for all of the links to things)) i found some picture or something of actual real flaming chickens merch. now i'm sure soemwhere in here, probably much earlier on, i complained about the flaming chickens merch store not actually having merchandise to purchase. and i would like to formally ask a rather badly formatted question going a little something like this: "omg omg omg can i please buy flaming chickens merchandise from you, it would be like purchasing pure dopamine and i would be eternally greatful in a very creepy almost obsessive sort of way". :3

happy new year (1/2/24)

OMG OMG I HAVEN'T WRITTEN HERE SINCE LAST YEAR (oh wow. such a funny joke (not actually a joke, entirely truthful statement that might happen to be humurous with the right tone and context (which i don't have here)). welcome to yet another year of this LTE, i'm still here, in 2024! if you'd told me when i started this in 2020 i'd be going 4 years later i'd be.. mildly dissapointed in myself probably. jk.. i'm dissapointed in myself a bit now, but 2020 me would think it's sooooo coolll i'm still here (she would be wrong). i guess though, it is a little bit cool i still do this, at least i found a way to write a diary without having to write on paper. i HATE writing on paper, it sucks. i think i may have some sort of dysgraphia.. i can't even format my thoughts on paper and it is physically painful to write. but typing is just fine thankfully, as we discovered a few months ago (idk i can't tell time) i have an above average WPM. this SUPERHUMAN TYPING ABILITY (slightly above average by a little bit) allows LARGE GIRTHY texts like this to FLOW GRACEFULLY from my fingers. i wonder if anyone else has been updating their LTE's, i have been on winter break so i haven't been checking (that's why the entries have slowed these last few weeks). i had something that i wanted to write here, and i forgot what it wass. DANGIT, valuable LTE content lost to my horrible memory. sigh, i hate my stupid memory and it not remembering my stupid thoughts. i have trouble getting things into my long term memory, short term is fine, and when i don't think about it long term retention is fine but when i try to remember something i DON'T! WHY?!? sometimes it feels like my brain is actively sabatoging me, bad user experience, would not reccomend this brain. i'm like noticibly neurodivergent, although, maybe it's just most noticeble to my family because my mom is a psychologist (degree and everything). also, my friend started writing an LTE, check it out here. i wrote more to this entry but then right after telling my friend "hey be careful not to overwrite your progress in neocities by not refreshing the page when switching computers" and then EXACTLY THAT and deleted more than half of this entry. if you saw it for the few hours it was up, you are now part of an elite group of only you that has that secret piece of LTE lore (mostly me complaining a great deal about premiere pro taking literally (not literally as in the modern usage where it means figuratively (the exact opposite) but in the actual meaning where it means the following or current statement is factual in a literal sense) 30 minutes to launch. i got it to work eventually though, isn't that great! okay, i have now reached the point i have nothing left to write about and start either ranting about semi-obscure philosophy or just talk about how i have nothing to talk about which is probably boring. i'm writing this during what would be d&d club if the DM was here but instead we're just hanging out (by hanging out i mean LTE writing and my boyfriend is sulking that i dragged him here instead of going back to his house to make out). i've been in hiding from the physics police for several years now, they still haven't managed to catch me, it turns out them not really existing corporeally makes it very hard for them to catch me, they have tripped me quite a few times but other than that i've managed to keep my distance from cliffs and airplanes (for the most part, some close calls though (one time i was in an airplane that suddenly had to drop down 30,000 feet to avoid a storm so for a while it was very turbulent and scary and floaty and such)). oki, byeeeeeeeeeeee (seeya later if i magically remember what i was going to write about through some stroke of luck or something (most of my memory seems luck dependant))!

p.s: i said i needed to stop the post-scripture-ing but here we are, just wanted to say only 42 days from tomorrow until the 4 YEAR ANNIVERSARY of my LTE!! wooo! so exciting (is it tho?)! me and mckenzie should plan something. mckenzie, if you're reading this, you should like.. plan something for us to do on the 14th of feburary 2024. anywho, bye bye (for real this time it's not clickbait i swear (or i guess it is because i'll likely be back to type here but just like not today so depending on how much time you assign to the average "bye bye" then it may actually not warrant a "bye bye" from your point of view and therefore be clickbait to you))! :3

i am obssesive and compulsive but hopefully not to the point of disorder (1/3/24)

listening to music and stuff in psychology class. i did pretty good on the test, i didn't even study. i never study actually, for any test, but like.. i do okay anyway so i guess i'm saving myself time to.. do this i guess (i'd be sacrificing my grades to do this anyway so). i'm listening to hot mulligan live from the basement. is "the basement" the name of the place they are playing in? is it a studio? it kinda just looks like somebodies basement with some free-standing sound paneling and amps set up, it could feasibly be their random basement but calling it "the basement" seems a whole lot more official. i guess they are a bit of a bigger band so it's probably some sort of studio or smth. i brought an entire large (nearly) 2L bottle of welch's mango pineapple juice to school today, i have already drank about a third of it. we have this teacher everbody hates at my school, and one of the OTHER TEACHERS (my psych teacher) has a poster taped to the wall saying "mr. *mean teacher name here* does not enter here. this is a safe place." like damn, even the other teachers hate this guy. i'm pretty sure he's only still employed here because of tenure. he is a pretty horrible teacher and a not-so-great guy in general so i'm not surprised. he is like actively intentionally mean to students, not just strict or smth. he seems like he kinda dislikes kids. ANYWAY, i have to take psychology notes now so byeeeeeeeeee seeya at some point in the near (or distant) future!

this doesn't count as post-scripture it's just later in the same day and i was like "i should write an entry today" but then checked neocities and i ALREADY DID. see what i mean about my memory? gosh. i feel like something bad is going to happen soon, i feel like i'm slowly being socially outcasted a little or something? like people forgot how annoying and horrible i was for a while and now they're remembering and trying to get away from me again? i tried to talk to somebody today and they went "i don't know you and you don't know me" despite there being many of our mutual friends around.. it might've been a joke but i feel like the sentiment was true, people are embarrased to be seen around me? idk, maybe i'm just paranoid. i kinda felt like for a minute people kinda liked me but now things seem to be going south? maybe i'm just noticing patterns that don't really exist though because i can't pinpoint many legitimate events where people have actively shown they dislike me but like.. it's just a vibe i get from everyone i talk to. did i change for a while to some more socially accepted version of myself and now i've changed back? i haven't conciously changed my behaviours, but maybe i've started doing something different and people don't like it? i have a constant feeling of "oh god what am i doing wrong now" and it's eating away at me. i feel like i'm going to break and have nobody there to pull me back to reality one of these upcoming times and end up dying alone, by my own hand, in total silence. wow, this entry got dark. i should tell more funny stories here, like, some lighthearted stuff about small inconviences and like.. the existence of certain genres of food or something. sorry for depressing all you loyal readers, i hope you all have a good day regardless. bye bye for now.

day 4 of 2024 (1/4/24)

wow already 4 days into the new year. here to write that i noticed that (before i wrote this entry obviously) the character counter ended in "666" which was a funny if not a little ominous sign. additionally, i just noticed that the text in the neocities editor is up to over 1,000 lines, that's cool. i just drank apple juice from the forbidden fruit, or at least it's heavily implied that i did. what i mean is that the apple juice is the brand "apple and eve" which seems to imply that this is the forbidden fruit which would also imply it has some connection to sin or something i'm not sure the exact logistics of that bible story but i'm pretty sure eating the apple is classified as quite a bad thing. i think this thought about the bible story made me primed to see the 666 in that number and that's why i noticed it enough to point it out (funny how brains work like that). a few days ago i saw my grandfather for the first time in 5 or 6 years and he's even weirder than i remember, but he's weird in an almost charming socially awkward kind of way. he collects lots of cd's and is very particular about his setup for listening to music (he let me try it out and it's great). he has a chair in a specific place in the room where if you sit in that particular chair then the speakers are angled to give that specific spot the perfect auditory experience. also the music he listens to is very.. queer? the first thing he put on was something that i recognized (i probably heard it from a midwest emo mixtape at some point), which was the album "lush" by the band "snail mail". like the last thing i expected to hear from this guy was an emo girlband that only got out of highschool a few years ago. i liked it though. he also had a literal flail on the floor, like a medieval weapon flail, just laying on the floor like a decoration? weird guy. pretty certain he's some flavour of neurodivergent (he said he might try to get diagnosed soon or something). oki bye for now.

i have a headache (1/5/24)

i have a headache rn, idk why. i think some people think i'm way healthier than i am because usually when i am in pain or feel sick i just.. suck it up and don't tell anyone.. which is probably not good for me but like- whatever i deserve to suffer in silence. anyway, we have to do this weird carreer planner thingy in highschool today and none of the options are my ideal lifestyle. this is like the highest form of pro-work propoganda. it is like "you are a cog in a machine, look at how many fake choices you have! enjoy it (but not too much)!" it's highly dystopian. it all seems like quite a downward spiral. anyway, i must depart promptly to go comply. must comply. byeeeee

i think the headache is because i'm dehydrated.

oh. my. gosh. guess what? no really, i mean it, guess! big news! did you guess what the news was yet? no? well i'm not going to tell you.... okay fine the news is that there is a new mckenzie LTE update! woo! isn't that so exciting! and if you were to guess further there might be sine extra information to be gleaned from this weird guessing game thing! yep! it's that I WAS MENTIONED in the entry! what?!?! crazy!?! also, erm.. i have no idea what to do for the anniversary, that's why i was asking you silly goose! my friends are all (all is an exaggeration but a fair few) starting to get jobs and that is scary and stuf.. i guess this is just a part of growing up, right? i don't know.. this whole "growing up" thing seems a little "off" for me.. i feel like i've only gotten worse.. like, i'm rapidly apporoaching peak unnattractiveness i feel like? my hormones are doing stuff and my body is becoming.. well to put it frankly not as quaint and girly as i'd like it to be.. idk, i probably should stop writing these late at night.. why am i even writing this at home?!? usually i only write at school but i've found myself updating at home more and more often, maybe that's part of growing up too. i'm desperately afraid of change.. almost all change, even positive change. okay, i'm gonna call my boyfriend (whos also getting a job ughhhhhhh) to help calm me down to go to sleep (it's like 3 AM). love you all, byeeee!

i have a headache part two (1/8/24)

i don't know what emotions i'm experiencing right now, but they are quite unpleasant? i was playing a song and singing this morning and my lip randomly started bleeding, that's probably a bad sign. i think i'm anxious about school, i'm falling behind but i just can't for the life of me convince myself to do ANYTHING EVER! WOOOO! i'm totally a failure.. like.. objectively (at least that's how i think others view me, and how i view myself). i can just talk randomly, like the good old days. i have no cheeseburger. somebody that sits next to me has revealed to me verbally the exisence of a day-old chipotle burrito and I WANT IT. I WANT IT NOW! GIVE IT TO ME. i don't actually want that specific food that badly, but i haven't eaten since like 5 (post meridian, also known as PM) yesterday. should i check my grades? i don't think i ever have before.. if they're better than i think i'll get a huge boost of motivation but if they're worse than i think i'll actually be LESS motivated to do the damn assignments. okay, so i only have one F right now, and i have a big assignment i can do for that and i think i won't have an F anymore.. other than that i still have like like 2 C+'s and a C which is probably not good but if i can get those up to to like b-'s i'll be fineee.. i hope. i'm going to work on that big assignment now. ughhhhhhhhhhhh. i'm dying. i worked on the assignment and wrote like 2 sentences and then that class ended so i had to stop to go to spanish class where we aren't allowed to do anythingg. so, idk what i'm gonna do.. i feel like i'm such a failure ahhhhhhh. okay enough negativity, i'm gonna go do class now. byeeeeeeeeeee

OMG I'M IN MY LAST CLASS OF THE DAY AND JUST REALIZED WE ARE NOW OFFICIALLY OVER 200K CHARACTERS! WOOOO!! celebrations everybody, i have now written a LOT. like a lot a lot, in an offical capacity! i will write about this more when i have more time to rant about the significance of being over 200,000 characters on this here LTE. i think i've written most of this in the last year despite having this going for almost 4 years, so crazy. okay love you all byeeeeeeeee!

the difference between MDD and feeling depressed (1/10/24)

i'm having to like come to grips (so to speak) with my clinical depression. like, i'm trying to look on the bright side, i am actively choosing to look at the positive side of things and i just can't. not that i don't know how, or that i won't.. it is clinical.. i quite literally cannot. i keep beating myself up about how i just am not good enough and i just need to learn, but it's like telling a blind person "oh you just need to see", i cannot. because it is clinical (not a state of mind but a mental disorder) it isn't a question of willpower or anything it is actually impossible to just suddenly be cured by a change of outlook, the outlook is caused by the disorder and there is no cure. this may sound trivial to you, but i periodically realize this and i think it helps me cope (i think, maybe it just makes things worse). it's the difference between "feeling depressed" and "having depression", they really should change the name of one or both of those thing because the feeling of "being depressed" is completely different from the mental disorder of depression. i suppose though that "depression" is just the everyday term.. the actual term is "major depressive disorder" i think. people should start saying MDD instead of "depression" to clarify between being depressed and having a major depressive disorder so that dumb kids such as myself don't hate themselves even more for not magically getting better. i am literally (as in not metaphorically or jokingly) never getting better (as in the disorder will never be cured, i can only learn to cope with it and treat it, but not get rid of it), and that isn't just me thinking negatively, in fact, it may help me think more positively about myself. see, this is a positive entry after all? i said i needed more of those! anyway, i have been eating lunch with sam (his website) these past couple days. i very much enjoy his company and i keep being like "oh hey i should like talk to him sometime and encourage him to eat lunch with me because i sit with more of our mutual friends than i used to (at least one) and it might not be as awkward for him" but then.. i never do? i'm bad at initiating interactions especially because reaching out online might seem a lil desperate and we don't have any classes together this year and stopping him in the hall on his way to somewhere (probably more important than me) would be quite awkward (for him and for me) so i just didn't really say anything.. idk if he still reads these, but if you are here, hey sam (ur cool)! okay i gotta go to my next class now (every class is only 35 mins today because of a district-wide 2 hour early release schedule (for no reason)). love you all loyal readers, byeeeee!

reflections on being over 203,941 (the amount in the original flaming chickens LTE) characters coming soon, i actually had ideas for what to talk about today and i save my LTEing-related topics for proverbial rainy days. :O

look mom, i'm on tv (1/11/24)

i made a movie in my film class and the whole school is going to see it today, wooooo. in some ways i'm proud of it, in some ways it's pretty shit. i didn't even get to make my own full cut of the movie because my damn premiere pro took literally (not exaggerating) 30 MINUTES TO LOAD. UGH. i think that objectively spiders are cute and i shouldn't be scared of them. however, i am still VERY SCARED OF THEM?! why?!? i'm not really scared of other bugs, why spiders? i think that spiders are cool and even cute but like I'M STILL SCARED OF THEM?!? whyyy must my brain be this way?? might add to this later, bye bye.

i didn't add to it later (1/12/24)

today is a 2 hour early release because everybody was pretty sure the SNOWSTORM was coming but it got delayed until tommorow but still 2 hour early release today so YAY! i'm tired. i'm gonna go visit my mom today for the weekend, it was gonna be a month until i see her next but we figured something out so i can see her this weekend, fun. Anyway, because of this early release i am now being released, so byeeeeeeeeeee!

there was a blizzard (1/22/24)

i'm not talking like a small one you get from dairy queen, no, i mean a REAL LIFE storm! everything was icy, then it snowed, then more freezing rain on top making the snow into a giant ice sheet. this of course made it impossible to go ANYWHERE and we had a whole week off school. nice one mother nature, little wintery wonderland break from the HORRORS of school. I am officially already old and jaded looking down at the generation after me, like.. the boomers might not like the millenials, that's fine. we absolutely HATE gen alpha.. like too much. anyway, i'm gonna go catch up on my LTE reading because i haven't checked in a while and i'm probably missing so much (i am not). okay, LTE recap for these last 2 or so weeks: knockton made a new entry. that's it really. really i'm serious that is all that happened plz stop asking!!!! because of the snow they moved the semester back, that's nice of them. This means i can procrastinate another week before I have to do all of the stuff i missed and then give up and only do one or two things and just barely pass all my classes with like a C. although, at least i haven't failed a class thusfar. that might change this year tho who knows, if i do fail a class my father will actually try to make my life a living hell, so i have to either never fail, or i have to just like move out of my dads but that might be difficult because despite the fact he gives me hateful vibes like way more often than a father should he also still wants me in his house. i think it's because it might look bad on him if i "get away from him" and start telling everybody the truth that he is a narcissist and horrible to live with. like.. i love my dad, and he will probably stay in my life in the future but i just need that level of seperation between him and me where he has no power over me. like, he really likes having and excerising power over people. idk.. i love him, but it feels like he doesn't love me. or at least that his form of love feels a lot like hate because typically you don't try to control and manipulate people you love but ig he's different. he is really protective of his image and so he won't let me leave the grasp of his control without a fight. we've both been trying to delay that fight i think, but it's inevitable unless he suddenly changes (he won't ever change). damn i started doing another diary entry kind of entry, this isn't a diary i swear (it kinda is tho)!! i'm tired today. i am very scared of change and i am dating somebody who really likes change and i really hate change but opposites attract i guess except life is torture but we really love eachother so we just gotta figure out a way to make it work. i just gotta make him not change so much.. which will inevitably lead to him feeling trapped and resenting me and me having to control and manipulate him in order to maintain status quo and keep him around. and there we have it folks, i'm literally just my dad. this is no fault of mine though, because i simply inherited the same mental disorders as he did! woooooooooo! i hate myself so much, why do i have to be such a bad person? this may sound cliche but like WHY CANT I JUST BE NORMAL?? also the thing above where i suggested i will conciously mentally abuse my boyfriend was just a like prediction of what could happen i am going to try my hardest to have that not happen but like i feel like that's what i am gonna do. i hurt people, that's just who i am. and if you're looking at this like "oh but you're a good friend you would never do that" you are WRONG you are not the exception! i end up hurting everybody eventually. jeez, that shit was dark, wasn't it! i am not in a good mental state i guess? i thought i was in a "a bit anxious but okay" mood today but i guess this whole writing thing kinda exposed my true feelings not just to you but also to myself, ya know? i didn't know this is how i felt until i tried to write it down. at least i wrote a LOT though, long entry woo! i am putting chracters into my LTE and who are you to judge what i write about (i am likely the only one judging me for this). god, i wish i could change more easily. i wish i liked change. i would try to change into somebody that likes change, but that would be change and therefore i hate the idea. i'm kinda stuck it appears. just in general, in life. stuck, that's what i am. i'm just rambling about nonsense now. i like rambling about nonsense because it puts MORE CHARACTERS INTO THE LTE. this is all unbelievably cringe, i am cringe. my own expression is not of value and is irritating to others. okay, maybe actually possibly i should STOP writing now so i stop being all sad and mopey and stressed and mad at myself and all of the other emotions i think i might feel. okay gtg bye byee have a good day love you alll!!

day 1,440 (almost exactly 100 days since the last entry with a "day marker", and also approximately year 3.95 of my LTE) (1/24/24)

i might've talked about this like last entry, but somebody who goes to my school died. we got an email last thursday and it was like really ahhhhhhhhh. i knew them but we weren't like super close.. i think on the stages of grief i'm still in denial cause like i haven't come to grips that they aren't ever just gonna walk into class. rest in piece i guess. life goes on.. i wish i could pause things for a while. anwyay, i wanted to update this but i don't know what to say past that. we are at a LARGE amount of characters now, that's pretty funny. that's cool. this is entry 86 of my LTE (i counted by hand (by "by hand" i mean mentally whilst scrolling, it's not like i counted to 86 on my fingers (which is possible but i'm not that cool)), is that special? maybe i should do something ultra special for entry 100, that'd be cool. speaking of miscellanious (not how you spell that?) milestones, the 4 year LTE-aversary for my LTE is on the 14th of next month (feburary)! mckenzie has still yet to decide on an event for this, or update the hub with a rules page, or make a new entry in a while (looks at you with a mildly angry and annoyed expression). although, you are supposedly sick rn so like maybe not the best time to write an LTE (just kidding ALL THE TIME IS THE BEST TIME HAHAHHAHAHHA). also spicey the spice root thing the spice the red one hi hello hi, i dont recall what i wanted to say to you. at least most of this LTE is now me talking about how bad i feel constantly over and over instead of doing meta-commentary on the LTE itself.. that was CRINGE (i guess).. but i guess that's what i'm doing now so i guess I AM CRINGE. WOAH. COOL. SO COOL. I AM SO COOL. i am going to perform at an open mic on the day before valentines (possibly with the amazing spice04 (read their LTE) as my bassist)), it's gonna be cool i'm gonna feel so cool and stuff. and it's one of those open mics where there is poetry too so people are gonna think i'm soo cool because my band is gonna perform (depending on whether spicey feels up to it "my band" may be literally just me). also, we've gotten a drummer, and we're gonna play together at some point. but drums are big and hard to transport so we have to play at his place except i don't know him that well so it might be awkward to go do band practice ALONE over there so basically what i'm saying what i'm trying to convey what i mean is that spice04 should actually come with me literally actually and so i'm not alone so if you're reading this you should learn bass to the point where you have the confidence to say that you play bass but like you don't actually need to be good just like pretend you're good and the goodness will come later idk how things work aaaaaaaa. it would probably help if i wasn't like REALLY BAD at teaching things like absolutely horrendous like you should probably just look up tutorials online. it's weird how looking up tutorials online and learning stuff through that is considered being "self taught" even though like somebody else is teaching you but since it's not like 1 on 1 in person lessons it doesn't count for some reason like i guess i didn't really learn from video tutorials like i just kinda looked up the tabs and played them after i watched like half of a video telling me how to read tabs.. but like somebody was like "are you self taught?" and i was like "no i learned from tabs online" and then they were like "oh, so you're self taught" and i'm like "okay that has changed my known definition of this word for me wow" except i didn't say anything actually i just nodded. my hands are getting tired because i'm typing this fast and so i'm going to stop typing now so i can like not have pain happen to me and stuff okay okay okay bye bye bye bye!

day 1,442 (1/26/24)

maybe i said this last entry but i felt a little sick yesterday and now today i feel VERY sick so that's FUN!! woooooO! have a good day because holy shit i am NOT!

day 1,446 (1/30/24)

i was sick for the whole 3-day weekend and i'm still kinda sick but i'm at school anyway because i hate myself! WOOOOO! oki seeya.

day 1,447 (1/31/24)

i got spice04 sick, whoops. sorry!

goddamnit lost track of day and don't wanna do the math (2/5/24)

im in a constant state of living but it doesnt feel like it for some reason like i feel like i have no life and i don't like it. i don't like me. i wish i was a real person. i wish i was a real girl, i feel like a fake (woah this is a really good example of dysphoria and i AHH). except i'm BACK i'm no longer actually sad just kidding no time has passed i just kept typing after the last sentence and TRICKED YOU into believing i'm a happy normal person. i conciously try to trick people into thinking this about me but i SUCK AT DECEPTION so like they all think i'm sad still which is NOT what i want because that's not "NORMAL". woe is me. i am woe. the concept of woe is synonymous with the concept of ME. i feel like i should've "gotten my shit together" already, and like.. "sucked it up" and "locked in" by now. but i'm still uncertain and it feels like everyone else somehow has "their shit together" but it probably isn't that way? this is probably irrational anxiety from my diagnosed anxiety disorder? MAYBE. HAHAHA. EEEEEEEEEEEEEE. cheese. say it. say cheese because i'm taking a picture. the picture doesn't include you i just want you to say it anyway to celebrate that i'm taking a picture.. of myself. it's a "selfie". nevermind on that i couldn't find a good angle so i made you say cheese for nothing, i didn't take the photograph. i've watched inside by bo burnham in the last few days can't quite place exactly what day and now i'm watching it again. well actually i have my phone in my pocket and i'm in class but i'm listening to it. i think at some point he calls you out for probably not watching and just listening to it in the background like i currently am. that's bound to be FUN and a bit scary maybe. we live in a dystopia. this is dystopian. everything is PAIN. okay bye for now love you guys!

the back that smiles snack shifdolg (2/6/24)

i've been really stressed recently for several reasons. i won't talk about one of them here right now but the other one is that SCHOOL EXISTS AHHHHHHHH!! okay i actually have just realized or whatever that i don't wanna type right this moment so bye for now. byeeeeeeeeeeee

overtly political LTE entry (2/12/24)

i've been seeing lot of people going around online saying things like "all these AFAB non-transitioning non-binary people with their excessive labels are saying even having a medical tranistion is transmedicalist" (like they will say that and not realize the irony in saying these people self-label too much whilst labeling them with a bunch of things smh (this also brings up this one really cool video i watched doing a retrospective on the MOGAI movement on tumblr and 4chan and other forums and how that movement is kinda dying out? (although it has kinda been revitilized lately elsewhere and along with the whole non-diagnosable split personality stuff which is a whole different topic))) and whilst i have see people say that, people are using it as a strawman for arguing and being transmedicalist and that's probably not good. the political landscape right now is volatile and i'm not quite sure where i fall. i feel like i have slightly strange political views. sometimes i feel like i'm not left enough to fit in with some crowds? anyway slightly related, being a binary trans person i'm like the "face" of what being trans means to people who are transphobic? it kinda feels like the transphobes (at least the ones facing the media) haven't "gotten to" the non-binary people yet? like trump talks about "transgenders" often-ish, but to my knowledge has never talked about NB people specifically? not saying they should target NB people LOL.. whatever ahhhhh my brain can't organize thoughts enough to talk about politics right now. maybe i will later. later meaning some other day, because today is almost over (school wise at least). i'm going over to the house of spice04 after school today, on the bus. i've never rode a school bus before except to go on fieldtrips and stuff.. maybe it will be fun? idk it's probably similar to a city bus but instead of bus stops they just stop at the kids houses. oki byeeeee

day 1461 (not a round number because 2020 was a leap year, dang) band practice reflection and LTE-aversary (2/13/24)

putting the promised political rant aside for now i went over to the house of spice04 (which as you all totally know is the bassist for my band) and we did a band practice! woo! we learned one original song, and one cover.. as a little band! it was actually so fun idk if i expressed properly how fun it was at the time but i very much enjoyed doing band stuff! they are just starting to learn bass and i'm surprised at how fast they were able to learn actually, i'm pushing them pretty hard i feel and it seems to be working out! i love when things work out. we didn't have an amp for the bass, but we did have a crappy old karaoke machine with built in delay and reverb effects which.. was not preferable but we got it to work eventually. i feel like with one or two more practices we'll be able to play at least like 2 songs, which means we're like totally a band now. like actually officially a band rather than like saying we're a band as a joke!! wooooooooooo! excitement! band! FUN! we'll be playing stadium shows in no time, we'll open for all of our favourite bands and stuff like that. well actually maybe i shouldn't joke about that, some of my favourite bands are pretty small and local and opening for them could actually be a realistic goal. hell, i know at least one musician who goes to my school who to my knowledge has never played an offical live show so i could probably convince them to open for us (although realisticly i would want to open for them cos i think they are way cooler than our band).

WAIT today is THE DAY!! it's the day today guys! everybody gather round the firepit and let me tell you a story about a lonely little closeted trans girl in 2020 who started this LTE exactly 4 YEARS AGO! THAT'S RIGHT! it's the 4 year anniversary of my LTE! this isn't that significant it's not like i have anything planned, but dang it's been a while. i started this a while ago. at least i'm not like the patron saint of paper clips.. this year is something like the 20th anniversary of their LTE. crazy to think about. do i have the record for the longest active LTE? as in the LTE that has been LTE-ing for the longest amount of time i'm clearly not the longest in terms of character count or whatever. we should get some official record keeping here, mckenzie runs the LTE hub but is sick and busy and stuff ALL THE TIME and i'm not even sure we're even getting a rules page any time soon so hoping for some more advanced LTE statistics pages would be.. unrealistic. unless mckenzie wants to come and prove me wrong? please? tomorow is also valentines day, which isn't all that significant me and my boyfriend don't really have high expectations for valentines but he was super cute and stuff because he was like "i don't have high expections for this but i want to ask what your expectations are" like omg that was a very like.. healthy relationship thing to do? idk it just felt really special he checked in with me about that cos he didn't want me to be dissapointed if i expected something. anyway we aren't gonna go out cos we're both busy tommorow but we might try to meet up extra this weekend (i think we both just want the excuse to). he's been really busy with work so i haven't been able to see him as much but i'll make it (i hope). speaking of not having plans, i have no LTE-aversary plans. you should make some though. go out and celebrate or smth. use it as an excuse to do some self-care or have fun with friends. reconnect with friends and family or whatever! also somewhere in this entry marks 222,222 characters, that's a lot of 2's! okay i'm getting bored of writing maybe i'll write later today or maybe i'll dissapear for a year, i've done it before! you really never know with me! i try to be unpredictable but i'm actually very predictable i'll probably be back tommorow (i can never spell tommorow correctly).
I could continue, but I'm alread bored. Cya! ^_^
(yes that's a flaming chickens LTE reference)

i stand CORRECTED mckenzie has started work on an LTE hub redesign apparently :0

day 1463

i wanna write in my LTE so i'm gonna do that. lets see.. topicsss... oh! i have one! so ya know how last entry literally like only a few seconds ago if you are reading this all in one sitting (not reccomended) i was talking about playing at an open mic (hopefully i mentioned this last entry it woudl be very awkward if i didn't), well i DID! isn't that so soo coolz! yea, i went okay actually! i didn't mess up horrendously! it wasn't like my best performance ever cos i was very nervous but it was at least tolarable! it was also my first official gig as concrete leaf which is my.. music name? author name? band name? i guess it is a band officialy now even though i played alone. funny thing is, i played alone even though the whole band was there. the bassist is my bestie so obviously they were there but also the prospective drummer was there (we've never actually played together but we're hoping to soon). this bodes well.. cos now once i make them both practice some songs or whatever we can do a full band gig and it will be super epic and much less scary than going up on stage alone hopefully! my goal in terms of time frame is to be able to at least play a set with the full band and maybe even get paid by the end of 2024. maybe even before i'm 17. if i can get a workable band together before i'm 17 i'll basically have my whole life sorted out. obviously (not too obviously actually) i'm joking but i'm also not joking because that is like pretty close to my goal in like.. life? i just wanna play sad music with my band and have fun, and then die.. that's the whole bucket list basically and if i can have that done before i'm 17 i'll be totally SET because after that if anything goes wrong i can just die. like once i've completely my quite achieveable bucket list of playing a decent show with my band in like a run-down pub somewhere anything else i do in my life is just extra and i can therefore not worry as much.. hopefully. and if that doesn't fix me there is nothing left to lose!! HA! i've solved life. what philosophy is this adjacent to? at least one other person must live life like this? right? no? oh shit.. damn. that sucks for me huh. anyway i'm gonna stop BORING YOU and LEAVE now. also new spice04 entry this morning, go read it it's deep. okay, byeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!! :3

day 1464

i beat celeste classic, was pretty short but i can see the inspiration they took from it to make the next game. i've already beaten the main game but i'm also playing on a crappy school chromebook and not a controller so my muscle memory didn't cross over and i sucked pretty bad. here are my stats if you're interested. okay bye!

day of me having a breakdown (2/20/24)

im having a breakdownn. i told my school counselor the situation and she said my dad sounds psychologically abusive and i think i may agree. i love him and he loves me but his love feels a lot like hate and i'm eeeeeeeee. anwyay, sorry for venting. might write more about this when i'm more stable. love you all, seriously.

day of me finding hope (2/21/24)

i'm determined to make some good of this. frankly, i need to get away from my dad (but now instead of thinking of doing that by suicide i'm actually gonna just make change). i hope to do this as soon as possible. i've recently found motivation in life generally in the form of this weird.. band thing.. and my friends/boyfriend. so, now that i have (mostly and temporarily) lessened the threat inside, i have now realized there is a threat to my psyche outside aswell and i need to get away from it to insure my health and safety. this has been a long time coming, it's just been building and builidng but this time it's different. i'm not afraid anymore, this is a fight for my life and damnit if i kill myself before i get to play shows with my band i'll be mad!! so i gotta stay strong and fight my emotionally abusive family in order to.. ya know reach that goal of living long enough to play in a band and do cool stuff with my friends, and move in with my boyfriend. so anyway, that's the plan! woo! i have passion towards a plan for once in my sorry life! it's like.. more of a goal.. cos idk how i'm going to actually.. do it. but.. it's a hope. i have hope, which is not something i have often. i've gotten my favourite part of the mixtape i'm listening to aswell, this is great. this entry is probably nonsense but like.. aren't they all!?! i don't owe you reason or logic! i owe you only TEXT. LONG TEXT! and that's what you're getting, so stop complaining or i'll call the physics police to your house like how somebody called the real police to my house! okay, love you all i'm gonna listen to this music and process emotions for a bit.

i'm in math class, so back to the mundane unless i get really anxious again. i'm trying not to think about it but even when i'm having a great day i find myself unable to pay attention to this guy talk about polynomial functions over and over. i think i may not be interested in this kind of math, because normally i love watching people talk about and teach me things but only when i want to learn those things. case in point (is this how you write this, sometimes i misshear common saying and think they are saying something else like the concept of "pay per view".. instead i heard "paper view" and was confused): i payed full attention through the entire duration of a 2 hour MIT linguistics lecture. i like linguistics and he was a moderately engaging teacher. i even let him explain and answer questions about assignments in this random class i'm not in, because i was imagining how cool it would be to do those assignments. linguistics is cool, if i ever go into a scientfic study, linguistics might be it. see? back to normal. my mom said i was astonishingly resilient. i also.. opened up to her a lot. i had to finally tell her about all the things i'm going through mentally. i was trying all this time to stay strong in front of her and thought it's about time i tell her what's going on so we can fight together. so i did on the phone last night. i managed to get my grandmothers landline phone working even though they had it unplugged when i came over, a bit suspicious but whatever. wow, you (averge reader) have NONE of the context here.. dang. i really don't want to have to explain this whole situation again so.. i'm just going to leave vague sentences here and there for now and maybe if i write a testimony in court or something i'll copy-paste it here. jeez, my teenage mood swings are getting to me today. but i can stay strong.. i.. hope. i mean.. i wish. idk. at least i have hope. god i'm repeating myself. i need to listen to some more music now and play some more celeste classic, i'm trying to get a better time.. so far best i've done was somewhere around 9-10 mins or smth. okay seeya love you! special thanks to my friends, ya'll are on my official list of "things that help you not want to harm yourself" they made me make!

update: got 7:19 just now. still pretty bad but fast improvement. not normally a speedrunner but this is fun. update again: 5:46

started reading my step-grandmothers book, about her re-discovery of childhood trauma and discovery of her DID system, pretty capitvating. sorta triggered me a little bit because of how much i relate to feelings of dissociation and depersonalization, so i'm gonna try to call my boyfriend now to calm a little. to be clear i don't think i have any sort of DID. more incoherence is coming in the future! but the fun kind instead of the depressed kind! i've set an alert on this page that will go off if i don't update it within a year apologizing for my presumed death.. hopefully you never have to see it! well i guess you will see it one day just hopefully not soon. if you are on this page and that alert pops up.. sorry for dying! or maybe i just get to a place in life i forget about this site and forget to update it.. in which case the version of me that made the site is also dead.. in a way.. so maybe it would still be correct on at least a philosophical level? anyways, as always, have a better day than me, stay more hydrated than me, and love yourself (unlike me). i love you all, if the universe is on my side, i'll see you tommorow (by "see" i mean.. write to in a way where i'm writing to the abstract hypothetical concept of a person reading this and not any one individual (although i do suggest at some points you interpret the text as talking directly to the reader (you) because i do intend it that way sometimes))! :3

thursday

got a 4:04 in celeste classic :3

friday (whoopsie) (2/23/24)

i may have done another whoopsie.. now i distinctly remember writing a MUCH longer entry (than a single sentence) yesterday and i think i might've done one of those silly whoopsies and DELETED IT (or forgot to save it). so.. to recap what i said in the now-deleted thursday entry: i've censored the finding hope day a little to not include details of self-harm. i also wrote about officially passing the hermnerp LTE and being 3rd place in the HUB (although the hub may not update to reflect this in a timely manner because the hub is the hub) and also that i am coming for mckenzies 2nd place spot (mwahahahahaha)! catching up to knockton may be a bit.. difficult. but maybe i can do it eventually. okay gtg, i'll hopefully write more later today, byeeeeeeee

new PB is 3:54.

mondayy

i survived the weekend. actually i more than survived, i thrived the weekend. i was at my mothers, and it was great. i got to see my baby sister.. now that i think about it she's not really a baby anymore, i've just gotten used to calling her that. hm. anyway, back on the train of moping about how my big bad sad dad had been to me. he is not good to me. and i can't live at his house anymore. i think i may have a good way out but it takes a lot of efforttt, and i hate putting in effort. james, while john had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher. perfectly grammatically correct sentence as it turns out, let me make it more easily digestible with context and punctuation. there is a situation in which two children (james and john) are in a classroom writing essays. in johns essay, he wrote "bob had a ball", in james' essay, he wrote "bob had had a ball". james' essay got a better grade (very short essays i know). this sets up the following sentence as true: james, while john had had "had", had had "had had"; "had had" had had a better effect on the teacher. great sentence. you know what a better sentence would be?? ALL HAIL THE HOLY PIE GOD! yep, great sentence. amazing. good message and everything. buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo. bison from Buffalo bully bison from Buffalo which bully bison from Buffalo. see? this is the kind of random i want in every single LTE entry. cheese! say cheese! i'm not pretending to take a selfie this time i just want you to SAY IT. gosh, now i'm out of things to write. damn. there is some weird conversations going on, this person has drank breast milk and eaten dog food BOTH ON ACCIDENT. i'm convinced they will eat anything in front of their mouth. they also talked about eating.. other things.. and a different kind of "eating". my body is like AH because of anxiety. okay gtg byeeeeeee

tuesday (2/27/24)

i think i need to stop having problems. my silly little LTE website can't handle me having problems, it's too silly! this should be fun and funny and mildly entertaining interspersed with me being bored in math class or something like that, not me talking about trauma i'm going to think about for the rest of my life! using this as a (slightly censored) diary does help though.. idk. maybe this thing will be silly and fun again once i resolve all of the traumatic life events i am currently dealing with, after that your regularly scheduled ripping off of the flaming chickens LTE and talking about character quotas and cheese will resume. okay, i have to go to school now, syrup!

tenpo mute li tawa li weka a, taso mi kepeken ala e toki pona. tenpo majuna la mi kepeken e ona. ken la toki pona mi li kama ike. ni la sona mi li weka a! ike a! tenpo ni la mi kepeken e toki pona. mi lukin e lipu tenpo sin, mi kute e kalama musi tan kulupu Mom Jeans. ni li pona a.

wednesday

been a week since hope day and i am going to have to wait ANOTHER week before anything happens quite possibly. dang. i can hang in there though. i just need to stay as comfy as i can and keep my motivation before i do.. the thing that i'm gonna do. except i SUCK at maintaining motivation so like.. idk if i can do it. but, i'll let you know. i want to do some sort of something with this website soon, add some more pages and stuff.. idk what to add tho. suggest things for me to add in the comments/guestbook thingy on the main page. i am existing. currently i am alive and still here and stuff. mi awen lon. tenpo ni la mi tawa a. mi o lukin e sina lon tenpo kama a!

i just donated blood! in return they (my school not red cross) gave me pancakes and a 20 dollar giftcard (and also a way to get out of math class)! oh, and i also helped people i suppose! so.. how are you? oh i forgot you DONT EXIST!!! HAHAHAHAHAAHHAHHA MWAHAHAHHAAHAHAH! philosophical question: can an AI write an LTE? He dreamed of leaving his law firm to open a portable dog wash. this sentence was AI generated, no human wrote this sentence.. so.. is it allowed? does this break the (currently) unspoken rules of LTE-ing?!!? HAVE I SINNED? or have i simply ADAPTED to the times. ya know.. the times? the ones we live in right now? these current times in which humanity is more doomed than ever? yeah, these ones okay, bye bye.

thors day

wow, i am like.. surprised by how time is working right now. it's so slowww, but also going fast-ly? idk how to explain it. there are internet things happening and i'm a bit glad i'm missing them.. even when i return to normal chronically-online life i'm going to try to avoid most of the centralised internet. gonna stay in my own bubble where i can enjoy media that i enjoy without fear of judgement or anything. my only social presense will be through my music i think. and maybe amongst my school on instagram.. idk. i'm just going to try to not get involved with drama, or like.. know about any potential drama. also, cancel culture.. definitely a thing. not sure what i think about it.. i mean, is it really productive to publicly shame people for like... having read harry potter at any point? like fuck JK rowling, she sucks. but.. the media she created is pretty good, and i reserve the right to seperate the art from the artist and read as much harry potter as i'd like (which is approximately zero.. but it's the freedom to do so without fear of social repercussion that matters). like, i can understand "hey this person sucks maybe don't take them seriously or give them money anymore" but like when it gets taken to like "the media created by this person, and anybody who has ever associated with this person is now completely worthless and watching it means that you agree with everything the person being cancelled has ever said". like.. no? that's just not how interaction works? at least that's not how it should work IMO. you shouldn't listen to my opinion though, as i've said, my political ideals are quite strange. like i'm a trangender person.. and i think guns are cool.. and apparently according to our current culture those two things cannot coexist? idk. so weird. like.. the right to bear arms is there so that we can fight back against the government idk how that got co-opted by facists and right-wingers but whatever.. okay, i have to go back to mi clase de esapa(insert n-tilde here)ol now. have a good period of time!

i added a better LTE hub button at the top and replaced the link at the bottom with red's LTE. woo.

froiduay (3/1/24)

didn't wanna like.. not have an entry today, so here i am. wooooo. so exciting. i'm so excited to be excited. ALL of my friends forgor to come to school today so.. i'm very lonely. literally, mckenzie, red, and my BF all didn't come today and NONE OF THEM ARE SICK. red woke up late, mckenzie said he forgot to come (probably is actually sick but whatever shut up) and my boyfriends brother got sick so he didn't come to school for some reason even though he isn't sick!?!? it's cos he's one of those people that is still really paranoid about covid even though it's like.. basically not a problem now. in my area it's like less common than the flu and worldwide statistics concur with my assessment but one person gets covid and suddenly my boyfriend is all "i can't come to school even though i tested negative.. just in case". i've been raised in such a way that i view staying home from school as a big deal and like people not showing up is like "wow you must be really weak" because i like try to never stay home from school.. like i go to school quite sick sometimes. ugh. i hate my biases against things like that.. like i know it probably is healthy to take breaks from school when you feel like it but my brain is like "wow they are all so weak and sensitive just suck it up" and i'm like WOW i DO NOT think like that! my concious opinion disagrees with my brain's learned bias. bleh. i forgot my headphones today so i'm really bored like what am i supposed to do to procrastinate!? research random things on wikipedia and learn the rules of triplanetary by reading a 6 year old play triplanetary thread on a very obscure forum and read through the entire PBF (play-by-forum) session and then get the rulebook and map digitally but not have any friends to play it with? no, of course i would never do anything like that.. i finished my grandmothers book a couple days ago, ending was good and empowering but i still hope all of the turbulant life events end soon so i can go back to being a "normal teenager with normal teenage problems" and struggle with things like boys and homework instead of a constant depression and suicidal ideation. okay, granted, the depression is chronic so i'll still have that but at least the suicidal ideation and self harm will go away.. i hope.. ugh. making change in my life is so hard. the saying is "it gets worse before it gets better" and right now is the part where it is worse. okay, i'm gonna go now. bye byeee. love you all!

happy first day of meteorological spring! equinox isn't until the 19th tho.

saturdayy (wow what?! weekend entry? no way!)

i looked up at the sky yesterday and the sky was mildly overcast but it was beautiful. the day prior i was walking with red and we commented about how it was like we were in our own little world. i like that. i just want my own little world where me and my friends can chill out and play music and worry about trivial things, like.. just existing as ourselves without resistence. i don't want to join the "big wide world" like my peers, i just want to have fun with my friends. okay, gtg, bye bye. have an amazing day and i love you all! look at the sky today.

found this blog post, definitely rings true and further expands upon my feeling of wanting my own little world rather than being subjected to the "big wide real world" which everyone seems so eager to participate in, this digital world of mainstream social media is not the "real world". we are slowly forcing ourselves into the matrix. like the gif on my main site says; delete twitter, make a neocities. take back the humanity and personality that social media has stolen from you. limit your time on reddit, tumblr, instagram, pintrest, youtube, etc. never ever watch "shorts" or "reels" or similar short-form content. delete tiktok, delete snapchat, delete facebook, delete twitter. support smaller individual real people/creators, not corperations or large groups. consume at your own risk. okay rant over, bye bye.

to add on to what i said the other day, and the concept of "deplatforming". generally, bad. i know, very controversy, but like.. intentionally silencing people has always been bad right? the right to choose not to listen is more important than the right to never have to hear anything bad. people (stereotypical leftists) focus so much on wanting to never hear anything offensive that they forget that same logic can be used against them if the dumb right-wingers were to just say "i find leftism offensive". i think society should focus MORE on freedom of speech for individuals instead of trying to silence them and like.. look around at all the giant corperations you are supporting because everything bad they've done can be more easily swept under the rug. i don't understand people who can participate in "deplatforming" on TWITTER (now called X for no reason), like you do realize you are currently using TWITTER to say somebody is bad!!? do you know what twitter is?! do you know who runs twitter?! HUH!!!?!?! like you realize the social trends in which you so gladly participate are being puppeted by governments and companies right?!?! how- how do people not realize? people need to come to terms with the fact that just ignoring people is more powerful than giving them negative attention in our society currently. all this isn't to say i'm not a hypocrite, i mean.. i seem like the perfect candidate to be this kind of person right? like i respect and empower minority groups AND think that social media is bad?! apparently a near unheard of combination of ideals in our current social climate. i think that trying to silence all opposition just makes it seem like we can't win the argument.. like i KNOW that queer people are valid so i don't need every piece of content that i consume ever to reaffirm that? i don't want to live in an echochamber. what are we gonna do once nobody is allowed to be wrong or make mistakes anymore? that sounds kinda dystopian. all that being said, i'm too far gone to be saved basically. i am indeed chronically online most of the time and i'm kinda just speaking this into the void in the hope that maybe the generation after gen alpha can be saved. idk. i'm talking to nobody here. maybe i should write a manifesto, that could be cool. also i'm really anxious and tired right now so like.. pretty much disregard this whole thing because i don't really know how i feel and i'm not sure if what i just said is completely representative on my actual views, i'm bad at expressing these sorts of things. ughhh maybe i should take a nap. once again, i'm just writing this for the sake of writing it. it's an LTE not a real blog! ha! you idiot, you thought i was going to say anything of value?!? NO. NEVER. I REFUSE. it's an LTE, if you want to be told how you should think go watch some propoganda (this brings up a point where people for some reason think they are immune to propoganda? but that's a disscussion i will pretend to have with myself at another time). anyway, have a good day. love you all!

i used to have a lot of journals. in them i would sometimes write about life but only ever in the way i thought i "should". the only real expression in my journals came from the slam-poetry-like song lyrics. it was stunted though because i HATED and still do HATE writing on paper. i was unsure why for a long time but since i was kindly enlightened by a friend of mine (of course the same friend, red) of the existence of dysgraphia, i think i probably have that. now i write in google docs, take audio tapes, and write into HTML consoles. speaking of that same friend.. erm.. i spend a lot of time with them i think? like.. we just slowly grew closer, and now we're best friends. i like being best friends with somebody, but it's scary.. maybe even more scary than relationships.. sometimes i wished i could be less attached so that it hurts less when i one thing too wrong and they leave. i wish people would stop leaving. i wish i was like a whole different person. i hate myself, my dad keeps saying "it's normal" or whatever, and it's one of the normal teenage behaviours and stuff. i hate that too. i'm a very hateful person. i feel like i've always been like this but maybe that's just my teenager-ness making me unable to look at the past without looking through the same lense. i view my friends or whomever i look up to as like gods compared to me, perfect and amazing beings. they give me happiness, so i just associate them with that and they become things of pure light in my subjective experience. this is probably unhealthy. i love my friends. espeically red and my boyfriend. they were both gone the other day, and i damn near had a breakdown. i feel like i'm putting up a mask all the time, if i were to let it down, i would just break down and scream at all times. i'm being intentionally socially isolated by my father, and its really hurting. i want to start a band, that'd be nice. wow, i'm all over the place right now. i expected from the movies that sex would rule my life by this point because i'm a teenager but i don't feel like that despite my relative success in that area. sometimes i wish life was more like the movies. i wish life was "better". god, i really am all over the place today. sometimes it feels like it's just me and a couple friends, honestly i like that. i never want to grow up. i better get this band on the road soon so i never have to grow up, i can just do my whole bucketlist in the next year or two and then die. is this the longest i've ever written on the weekend? it might be. crazy! i just wanna put more characters on here and i also need to vent sometimes and those two goals tend to come together to make this monstrocity! eeeeeeeeee. okay, i'm gonna talk with my boyfriend or red now.. actually my boyfriend is at work like always but i'll try to get in touch with red but i may not be able to, they tend to be a little hard to get ahold of. love you all, bye!

sun day

ugh.. i exist. you exist? how is your existence? oh wait you're just a READER! you can't respond directly! tehehehe. another week is going to happen next week, i have hope i'll make change though. a week from now i'll either be out of the hole i'm in, or dead. i'm just going to keep going as if this week doesn't define my entire life. procrastinate a little but not too much, get my school work done.. and maybe die if the justice system isn't on my side. but- what can you do i guess? beep boop. i wish i was a robot that goes beep boop instead of a human that goes wah wah like a little baby every time something goes wrong for her. ugh. maybe i should try to do an entry every day this week so that i can document whether things go good or bad. good news is that if i don't die my life will be like- fixed basically? that's gonna be great, i can focus on school and my band and my friends and it'll be great. i mean- i'll still have my crhonic mental health issues but i'll have actual help and much less stressors and triggers. okay, have a good day! bye bye!!

moon day

it's a new day, new me! except that the new me is basically indistiguishable from the old me. i said i was going to try to do one of these every day this week so i'm going to do that. and also because we a right on the cusp of 250K characters! i have to get to 270K to beat mckenzie. if i write at least 4K characters a day for these next 5 days i'll be ahead! oh god, this gives me flashbacks to the word quota. these flashbacks are completely metaphorical of course because i don't have a good enough memory to remember writing about it but it's written here by somebody that was presumably me so i must've had the memory of creating it at some point. i think the old character quota was 3,000, so i'll have to do even better than that. for reference, thusfar i have written approximately 800 characters. i have to do 4X this! every day! i'm definitely not going to be able to do it. especially because this week is the cutoff date for all my school assignments and i probably should work on those. although, i do only have like a 50/50 chance of making it to next week so if that is the case maybe i should work on passing mckenzie sooner. ya know, unless the snowflake has been damaged in some way, all snowflakes have exactly eight points? they can sometimes have 12 if two stick together but by default a single snowflake will always have 6 points due to the molocules of ice they are made out of forming hexagon (6 sided shape) patterns. if you ever see somebody make a snowflake with more or less than 6 points it's a snowFAKE and should be BURNED IMMEDIATELY! i've been learning to drive recently.. and by learning i mean literally just doing it. i've been driving around the area and listening to music, it's been nice. although it does require me be in the car with my dad which kinda sucks, but whatever he's nicer than normal when i'm driving anyway and we bond (to the extent to which we can "bond" at this point) over music. i haven't driven on the freeway yet though, that might be scary. idk. it kinda seems like the freeway would be easier tbh, maybe more dangerous but you basically just drive in a straight line so it's a lot less involved. guess i should probably try the freeway soon so i can like- go on roadtrips and stuff. i'm at the age where i could have my license and probably should've by now but in my state you HAVE to take drivers ed and i DONT WANNA so.. i'll probably just wait a little longer to get my full license. how many characters am i at? idk, i'll check. 2500 chars thusfar apparently, almost to the old word quota. let's see, if i write 3K a day for 5 days i'll have written 15,000 characters. i'll be at 265,000 by the end of the week at that rate. only a few thousand away from mckenzie, i can probably fill the remaining 4K or so just boasting about how i'm ahead now until he eventually comes out of LTE stasis and writes and rediculous amount and takes back 2nd place. who knows, maybe someday i'll even be ahead of knockton since he's kinda inactive for the forseeable future with college and all. maybe i'll get this published as a novel, like a memoir or something. i'll self-publish on amazon books or something. ya know, if i ever reach 500K characters i'll publish this as a real-life book! wouldn't that be funny! okay, gtg now to talk with red (one of my favourite things to do apparently), byeeeeeeeee!

mars day (apparently the etymology of tuesday? explains why it's martes in spanish though)

mckenzie mysteriously reffered to MARCH 4th as a date that something HUB related was going to happen but that was YESTERDAY and nothing has occured! anger! the holy pie god will send down it's divine retribution and smite thee if thou art not LTE-ing!! that's code 2 of the pink-ish pickle handbook BTW, yep that thing is still canon i decided. yeah, i keep saying this to make words but i must not be "real" any longer. i must be UNREAL. i must LTE, not do this sad journal thing. i love placing unnessesary restrictions and expectations on myself, can you tell?!?! tehehehe.

etadpu: mckenzie actually DID update today! it was about HUB renovations and the 4 year anniversary!

odins day (mercury day causes miercoles in spanish)

short entry today! i didn't write a whole lot cos it was a busy short day and i was playing triplanetary by email with red. maybe i'll write more tommorow or something.. hopefully. definietly not making the "quota" yesterday or today. bye bye peculiar pickle people!

friday (frigga day or day of venus (viernes))

eeeeeeeee, i am still alive. i think i'm okay right now. trying not to think about grades and just enjoy the moment (the moment being right now) and just chill out. been playing some guitar and having an okay time. i am excited for film class because i get to talk with red. i'm not feeling depressed right now! just anxious. that's nice. well i mean it's better than both. i wish it was tommorow already though. okay, i've discovered i'm not in the mood to write right now by asking myself "am i in the mood to write" and the answer being "not really" so byeeeeeeeeeee!

apparently it's been more than a year now since i created my homepage and made this a "real website" instead of a single random page with a lot of boring text on it and no formatting. now there is (barely) formatting, and extra features like a dynamic counter and.. a button that goes to the main page! woo, so much progress (not really). the main page is going to have something new and exciting on it soon and you may think "oh wow i wonder what that could be" and the truth of the matter is i'm thinking the same thing! i also don't know what is going to go there (yet). i guess we'll just have to find out, won't we? anyway, that's all for now. i have to go take a maths test soon, but i've been trying to care less about grades so maybe it won't suck. okay, bye!

my "just kidding, i dont exist" thing may have originated from the asperegus (cant be bothered to spell that right im in a rush) warfare page? the first message is "sorry, i dont exist".. weird. maybe it's just great minds thinking alike. just kidding, i dont exist!

hold on- why did i say yesterday was friday? (3/8/24)

uhhhhhh.. yesterday was thursday, today is friday. either i have amnesia, there is a groundhog day scenerio, or i somehow thought it was friday yesterday? i am so confused. okay, got to do math now. bye bye! i'll try to come back tommorow but no promises!

i didnt come back it's monday now

lol i had to go to a funeral (don't worry nobody i was close to) on saturday, so i did not write any this weekend. it is now moon day once again and i am tired and tired and did i mention a little bit tired. we're watching a video about colour theory in film class and i hate colours because i suck at seeing them.. weird that a half of my website name is a colour, but ig it is like "ish" which makes sense because i can only view colours as "close enough" to what they are called. i am not paying attention at all, i'm going to make the damn movie in monochrome so i don't have to worry about it. i am pretending to take notes about the colours but all i'm hearing is "blah blah blah blah colour blah blah". i wish that instead i could just talk with people all day instead of getting like limited time. i long for the feeling of not having anything left to talk about and getting bored because we've talked for so long but i don't get that very often nowadays because i am a bit isolated. warm light lmnmao color camnt tempiyure! hahahaha. red wrote that last bit, they spelt things so wrong i have no idea what it means but- it's there. jk i tge auther of pinkish piuckle wrote that, dw i wont lie 2 u again! :)

(as you can probably guess, red wrote that last bit too.)

i missed yesterday whattt (3/13/24)

yeah i didn't write any yesterday because it was a B-schedule day and also because i was (and am) working on a website for a secret society i'm totally not part of. has some pretty cool css animations and stuff, cool tabs and things. such top tier web development by yours truly. anyway, i have nothing else to say i just didn't want to go too many days (too many is apparently more than one at this point) without updating here. gotta add to that big old character count. such characters. all of them exist and stuff. i wrote them all with this here keyboard.. actually i didn't write them all with this keyboard, but probably most of them though. have i mentioned i type wrong? yeah, i don't do that homerow thingy and i type most characters with my pointer fingers but i have above average WPM so i don't really give a bleep. HEY, DID MY LTE JUST CENSOR ME?!?! reminds me of mckenzies LTE. speaking of, despite him supposedly working on the LTE hub i'm still listed as 4th place! blashphemy!! anywho, gonna try to get red to record some bass for some songs tommorow, and maybe do some backing vocals. then go on a world tour and be the bestest most coolest band ever! okay, seeya, love you byeee!!

whiletrue LTE update! (3/14/24)

YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT! for the first time in several years the whiletrue LTE has been updated, it's a sort of self-depricating final entry sort of thing but it is an expansion of the LTE nonetheless! woo! i have also updated my LTE recently.. which you probably already know because i'm doing it very often by LTE standards wherein LTE-ers regularly vanish for considerable amounts of time. also a mckenzie LTE entry! so many characters! i must "up my game" in order to get that 2nd place spot! it is required that i get the 2nd place spot!! i am writing characters! i am writing words! there are words on your screen that are taking up characters! that spot is as good as mine you NERD! also i am officially second (writing second because 2nd is shorter and i need more characters!) in the LTE hub because mckenzie finally updated the placements and characters counts which were immediatly invalidated because i expanded my character count with this entry! mwahahahahaha! also, i'm coming over the crest of 260K, mckenzie has also pulled ahead to 277K though so i once again have a while to go! i am currently eating school pizza which is bad but at least it's like real slices of pizza now until instead of like weird square things. i need to write more! mckenzie just said "that's what everyone says, smaller is better", i think that might be some information leaking through. i think that might be representative of some measurement of some other bodily part.. if you know what i mean. i am only a few hundred characters away from the 260 thousand character mark! that sentence might have done it! maybe this sentence did! i don't know! oh my lord i'm actually 20 characters away which means that actually this sentence puts me to over 260 thousand! woo! such hype! hyper! hyperactive! attention deficit hyperactivity disorder also known as ADHD is a psychological disorder often defined by poor focus (or occasionally hyper big super big large focus), poor impulse control, trouble with executive function such as routine and ordering of tasks which can lead to things like BAD GRADES IN SCHOOL! the WORST THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD! my grades in school actually define what kind of person i am for the REST OF MY LITTLE LIFE! woo! i love attaching arbitrary letters or numbers to represent peoples intelligence or ability in a given area! that's totally not bad and dystopian at all! woo! end stage capitalism is great! you should read my anti-facist anti-capitalist manifesto that is on the documents page of the white raven society website that i am in NO WAY associated with! you can find the link to that completely unrelated website in my last entry at like the beginging! begginging! bgienging! beggining?! how the hell do you spell that!??!?! AHHHHHHHHAAAAHHHHH! spellling is soft! just kidding it is very HARD! and by HARD i mean DIFFICULT! get your head out of the gutter! don't you know heads don't go in there?! those are for collecting rainwater and keeping it from seeping into the foundations of your home or something, not for storing HEADS! wow, look at all this writing i'm doing so quickly! aren't you scared??! aren't you scared mckenzie! i strike fear even into the eyes of the great knockton! someday i will be in the 1st place spot for all time with MILLIONS OF CHARACTERS!!! MWAHAHAHAAHAHA! i wonder how long it has been since i was last ahead of mckenzie? surely it's been quite a few {insert unit of time here}, right? maybe. then again, maybe NOT! this little class is over and i have nothing left to write about so i'm just going to GO AWAY now! bye byeeee!

the day i day (3/18/24)

i didn't write over the weekend, i am very tired today. i am ahhhhhhhhhhh! i saw mckenzie actually got a grid working, good job mckenzie, very nice grid. today is an A schedule even though it's a monday and should theoretically be an A/B schedule because we have friday off. dang. i have lunch after this class though, so that's nice. i get to talk at Red about various things that've peaked my interest recently which i know exist but i for some reason cannot remember right now? i guess it's probably better that i don't tell you dear reader about these hypothetical conversation topics just in case you (dear reader) are actually Red, in which case the conversation may be somewhat boring as i'd be restating (with likely the same phrasing, cos ya know, some person) what you had just read. i found out the word people used to use in old english before we started using the clockwise/counterclockwise system fo spin direction (probably because clocks hadn't yet been invented). the word for clockwise was turnwise (reffering to the way that the sun moves around the sky in the northern hemisphere) and the other word (for counterclockwise/anticlockwise) is WIDDERSHINS! what kind of maniac came up with the word widdershins?! i'm gonna go look at the etymology. apparantly it comes from a middle-german word that is very similar which means "against direction" (direction actually was a sort of synonym with "sun" at the time (the word for sun and direction were both "sin")) which makes sense but still a very funny word. also apparently going counterclockwise was associated with being unlucky, so.. huh. anyway, gotta go do work now. byeeeeeeeeeeeee!

the day after that last day

today is going alright, i got to talk to red in MIA. erm.. not much else has happened. the morning announcement video was wrong again about what lunch we are having, either the morning announcements people need to be checking closer to the day or the lunch ladies need to be more predictable.. probably something like a mix of both. i wonder how common being able to be 'in love' (however the hell you define that) with more than one person at a given point is.. strange that kind of thing can happen, right? how mysterious human emotions are.. feelings of reciprocated love (and other adjacent ones) are some of the best though (weird that i'm capable of like.. being loved by anbody, i'm not a very emotionally attractive person i wouldn't think..). speaking of human emotions, i've been feeling lots of those lately for many different reasons, some very negative and some very postive.. been a bit of a wild ride lately and also an anxious time because i'm just on the precipace of big changes in my life but i just gotta wait like a month first and that span of time is the perfect amount to be quite soon but also an eternity in different ways. i'm in one of those times where i'm wearing a lot of acessories. today i'm wearing glasses (those are also useful though), 7 rings, 2 bracelets, 2 scrunchies (as bracelets), and a necklace. and ALL of those individual items have different stories, like tattoos that you can take off (or misplace and never see again and then be sad). specifically the 7 rings have special emotional significance. i never take them off (except to get in the shower (after which i put them straight back on)). each one has specific memories and people attached to them and they come from various different places with their own memories and from different people. there is even some personal significance to which fingers rings go on (based (mostly) on which rings they are replacing). and i put them on in a specific place every time except for when i make deliberate changes to the order (i usually go at least months between changes). sorry to ramble about the rings.. ya know now that i think about it i've probably rambled about them before but i guess this is review. remember to do your LTE homework guys! it's times like this i wish i had a real private diary sort of thing instead of this not-so-private (but i guess relatively unknown) website. because there are some things i'd like to 'vent to the void' about in more detail but my outlet for that is a bit.. not actually void? i mean, if i talk about troubles with my parents, or with peers, there is a (small but noticible) chance it might get back to them or like 'in the wrong hands' and whilst i'm kinda an open book most of the time i still want to at least be a book with a front and back cover, ya know? some things (like stuff with my parents) are more time sensitive, so i can talk about them eventually just not now. ya know like.. nvm gtg.

the end is never the end (3/31/24) (this isn't an early april fools joke)

so.. you may have noticed the daily updates have stopped. that is unfortunately because the school district has blocked neocities entirely. this is.. highly problematic for several reasons. one of the main ones being i can no longer update this site from my school laptop. however, i am a stubborn bitch. so, i don't intend on ending this! as the reverand mother said: "our plans are measured in centuries, we have other prospects". entries will probably definitely slow down (epecially because i recently realized how behind (failing) at school i am and i need to fix that). but once i get school back on track expect entries to pick back up again because i can just write during school and then update the site later. so, you should expect entries in batches.. OR alternatively you'll never hear from me again, i will abandon this and the death counter will go off and everyone will think i'm dead. it is my destiny to be the next eon337. in a way, we (the LTE community) are all eon337. i guess never hearing from me again randomly has always been an option, remember when i dissapeared for a year in 2021? that was so silly. so.. maybe that will happen. maybe you'll get an entry from me next week. no idea. this text has helped me trumendously (that is probably spelled wrong) with my mental health surprisingly.. like a little outlet, so i can live in the present, if only for a few hundred characters. anyway, just wanted to let you know where i've been and where i'm going and all that. seeya later (or never again)!!

i wonder when i'll die (04/9/24)

Heya! I’m back after my LONG absence (1 week), just kidding, i don’t exist! I’d never reuse a joke ever! Anyway, i don’t really have much to say but i’m bored in class and i figured i should vent here because it’s one of my healthiest coping mechanisms. I listened to the acoustic version of the thrash particle by modern baseball on repeat for like an hour yesterday, i’m gonna listen to it again right now. Also, i’m editing this in a google doc which is technically controlled by the school so hopefully i haven’t write anything in here that would get flagged, i tried to redact some of the curse words in this version. Honestly idk why i pasted the whole thing in here to add to it as i’m only going to copy the text of this entry back into the LTE anyway.. It just feels wrong to write the LTE without having the rest of the LTE in the terminal.. or in this case in the google doc. In a way, i’ve returned to my roots.. This LTE started in a google doc, and it was destined to come back eventually i guess. I just got back from spring break yesterday, so that’s cool. I had a pretty good spring break, and then on monday i got to go over to reds house to hang out and watch the matrix. We had a good time.. Or at least i hope they had a good time, i certainly did. Mckenzie was thinking about setting up his own web hosting on a home server, that’d be cool. You know what isn’t cool? My back hurts, and my neck, and my limbs, and my head. I am achy all over for NO REASON! I played a bunch of dwarf fortress over the break, it was one of the only games i could get to run on my grandmothers chromebook (i used the inbuilt linux virtual machine). I was staying in my grandmothers attic for most of break, it’s nice up there. D&D is cancelled today, what a travesty. I’m gonna be all like “oh no why is D&D cancelled today, what a travesty”. So idk what i’m gonna do after school lol, i’m tired today. More than yesterday. Which is weird because i got more sleep that night than last night. My hands feel dry but in like.. A bad way. I feel dehydrated even though i’ve drank more than usual, maybe i didn’t drink enough yesterday? No, i had some milk at red’s.. I have no idea. My body is an enigma. I don’t get it, ya know? I don’t think it gets me either. It keeps whining at me in the form of pain and i ignore it because that is the “correct” thing to do, or so i’ve somehow convinced myself. I’m in spanish class now, isn’t that silly. I think there is things i’m forgetting but i’ve been distracted by various things, most of which i can’t say here. Spelling is hard jesus, i just misspelled “anyway” 4 or 5 times. Wow. anyway, bye byeeee! Love you all loyal readers!

4/15/24

My dad sets me up for failure and then punishes me for it. I’m basically grounded (“not allowed to go anywhere” (including to work on school projects I guess) until I get the therapy appointment scheduled with this one place, but the company that he wants me to schedule with literally has zero spots open. They are going to try to make a special exemption for me and squeeze me in somewhere they said but that wasn’t good enough for him. He literally set me an impossible task and is now punishing me for “not doing what I was supposed to”. I try to keep my cool, and be a good kid, and not rock the boat. It isn’t my fault, I literally went above and beyond to attempt to complete the task I was told to complete and it isn’t possible. On top of that, Ms. Sacks (hello) proceeded to scold me for being out of class unsupervised. I’m trying very hard not to break down in class. I’m probably going to be yelled at by my dad for talking back or something when I get home because I tried to explain (rather calmly) that I was unable to complete the task (for reasons completely out of my control). He was already mad I didn’t magically call over the weekend and he still is mad at me now. I hate myself so much. It’s so ironic. This is one of the situations that makes me need therapy in the first place! Even better is that the place I was trying to go after school was to my friends house to work on a school project. What the hell! I was already in a bad mood (for admittedly like no reason other than being back in my dads house (which makes me feel like a wimp whenever I say it but even being in that house alone triggers me)), and this has just made it infinitely worse. My friends are my support. Talking to one of my friends is so much better than therapy and yet I’m in trouble for this. I feel like everyone hates me for being a mopey bitch sometimes, and I would agree. Typing this made me feel very very marginally better, I guess that’s good.

4/29/24

Hello again! I am still here. Wearing different shoes for the first time in like.. Years.. They’re pretty comfy cos i got them used. A few days ago I played with red at an open mic! That was super cool, we played 3 songs. I think people might’ve actually liked it, which is surprising. Also, the bass was out of tune the whole time which wasn’t reds fault actually we just didn’t tune it beforehand and so they had to improvise.. Yeah.. whoops. Anyway, other than that it went great! I wouldn’t have had as much confidence without them there anyway so they should-

4/30/24

Right, i got cut off yesterday because the day ended. There is NEWS. me and my boyfriend broke up, but we are still friends and i hope it stays this way. Me and red were actually in love and now we’re dating. Crazy. The first inter-LTE relationship (to my knowledge). Anyway, gotta dash. Seeya!

I’m a bit of a compounder. As in, a fan of compound words, i guess. Sometimes i compound words that i don’t realise people don’t general write compounded. Like.. “goodmorning” and “goodnight”, which i write all as one word. Is “telemarketing” a usage of the root “tele” (meaning from far away) and the root “marketing”, or is a word made from blending “telephone” and “marketing”? Hmmm.. i could probably put “tele” before any word and the average person would be able to get what i’m talking about.. Like if i say i’m “telereading” you may not know exactly what i mean but you will know that i’m reading from far away? Is “tele” a productive feature of english, like a suffix? I should write some sort of linguistic thesis about using things like “tele” as affixes. That’d be a cool infix tho, just to mark whether something is happening from far away. I’ve done some research, i am not the only one who thinks this i am just uneducated. Apparently i have a very narrow view of how often something has to be used as an affix to be considered an affix, wiktionary has LONG lists of all the affixes in english, some of which only have like 2 uses to prove their affixness; among them, “tele”. I kinda HATE spelling things correctly even though i’m good at spelling and often spell everything intentionally correctly. I think things like “spellcheck” should only apply beneath things that are typographical errors, because otherwise this discourages the coining and development of new words like “affixness”, and puts those UGLY RED LINES beneath them. Such a shame people have to be so prescriptivist. Also something i didn’t know, nouns in old english are gendered! Interestingly, protoindoeuropean had an animate vs inanimate gender but no gender gender, which is interesting. When it evolved to have gender it had 3 actually, one of which was a specific nongendered gender, which is cool. Eventually english lost all (except for those words that are actually specifying gender) grammatical gender which is honestly preferable. Now i’m just ranting about linguistics ughhhh, at least it’s distracting me..

5/9/24

Wow, i haven’t actually updated the website with these entries in a long while.. I will this weekend I think, or like.. Tomorrow. Maybe i will today.. No i wont. I have an AP test today, so exciting. Honestly not too worried about my performance on the test, just sad i have to miss 6th period and happy that i get to miss 4th period. I was excused from all classes today due to the AP test but i showed up to 2nd period anyway because we had a different test, so fun. I’ve got a steady supply of chocolate milk and ate a good breakfast though so theoretically i should be good.. Other than the fact we have to skip lunch to do the test.. They planned it to be right at 12 so idk when they thought we’d eat lunch.. Hopefully it doesn’t take more than an hour or so because i don’t wanna miss all of MIA.

5/13/24

It took WAY more than an hour, like 3 hours actually. Was not fun. Missed all of MIA. anyway, i have not much more to write about. I’m sorta still teetering on the edge of change, like.. Perpetually. This week though.. This week everything changes. That’s rather ominous. Seeya later!

guess who is back (me) (5/31/24)

My mom and dad are officially going to court (again) for custody of me! WOO!(?) (update on 6/29/24, this did not work out unfortunately, my luck sucks) anyway erm the actual cool nice good news is the fact that i wrote (completely unprompted by the american school system) an essay about my search for information about the basque millers numbering system!

Here it is!
okay, i'm finally actually writing in the html terminal again! it feels good! ha, i haven't dissapeared! I've actually just been writing in a google doc and now i'm finally pasting and formatting it into here and making the page for the basque millers numbers also. wooo! i've done a thing. okay, seeya if i ever remember this exists again!

okay i know this entry is weirdly formatted already but i've just commited to breaking from the template at this point.. anyway, i noticed something. something BIG. LARGE. some NEWS. i am very very close to padding for more characters okay wait should i check yet if i'm over the threshold? idk. anyway.. i'm very extremely quite close to being able to say that i in fact officially HAVE MORE CHARACTERS THAN MCKENZIE!! that's right mckenzie! in my off-time i have been writing and preparing. i've known this day would come, and now i have finally done it. you have been beaten! i have taken second place!! MWAHAHAHAHAHA!! this is my first time being ahead since like... forever ago! like literal years i've been plotting planning and scheming for this! HAHAHA! i'm going to brag about this to your face on monday mckenzie!! actually no wait, i can't wait that long! i will brag about it to you on discord RIGHT NOW!! HAHAHAHAHA!

happy pride month! (6/1/24)

lol my webpage on the basque millers numbering system (a copy paste of an article i submitted to the school newspaper with the caption that they should not accept it) is now the 3rd result on google for 'basque millers numbering system' which is really funny. i also found a reddit post asking for more info (the 2nd result) and they only info they recieved was the same info (which is apparently the only info online) i came across. dang. anyway, go read it, link in the above entry. i am now one of the worlds leading researchers in the basque millers numbering system, that's funny. my page appears before the wikipedia for the basque language which is WHERE I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT. my page now contains more info than the page that started me down the rabbithole. lol. anyway haha mckenzie i'm winning now! sidenote: maybe i'm just really really unlucky and all the bad stuff that happens to me is actually not all my fault? okay anyway bye bye for now!

nearly the end of pride month now (6/29/24)

hello loyal readers, i am back for a short entry to tell you i'm doing much better mentally. bad things have indeed happened since last entry i think idk my sense of time has been weird since school ended. knockton is back for some more entries! nice. to respond to knocktons latest entry, the school system is i think mostly the same. 2-3 months off for summer, it varies by about a week each year depending on the number of days we have off because of excessive snow. also congrats to knockton on your first year on university! kinda weird that school year is over. i passed all my classes though, that's good. anyway, not much else to say! it's summer now so expect entries to slow down (i guess you probably are already expecting that because i haven't done one in almost a month), or maybe even stop.. until summer is over. i expect then i will start doing them more frequently again, although it may end up that i don't actually update the webpage with them more than once every couple weeks, but there will be CONTENT eventually i assure you. bye bye all! have a good however long until the next entry!

whoops another entry (7/08/24)

well, i guess i couldn't stay away for long. i'm starting an intensive outpatient program because of an emergency room visit a while back. this is my second week of it. it's group therapy, which is cool. i wanna feel like it's productive to write here for some reason even though it is definitely not, i usually use this when i'm avoiding work so maybe that's why. i've been interacting with people online a lil more, or trying to. i even had a short wholesome convo on discord with viba (the writer of the whiletrue LTE)! i think all these people in my therapy group are in liek different states.. idk where tho, maybe i should ask. it's online btw, i'm not just pulling out a computer in the middle of an in-person therapy group. i should write more cool like umm.. articles and shit.. on obscure topics.. like the basque one. i kinda wanna go to college for linguistics.. i keep thinking there is a D in college. is there in the european spelling? wait.. college. no i'm pretty sure there is no d.. weird. hey! i'm rambling holy moly! i'm doing it.. i'm LTE-ing but not in a sad way. great. right.. i should maybe pay attention to this group session a little more. seeya when i seeya!

mi ken toki kepeken toki Toki Pona. ni li jo e kon seme? ni li jo e kon ni ala ni: mi ken ala toki ike? ala. mi ken. mi ken pana e pona kepeken nimi. kin la mi ken pana e ike kepeken nimi. mi ken pana e ike sama ni: "sina ike", "sina o moli". sama ni la mi ken pana e pona: "sina pona", "sina suwi", "sina pona e lon mi". mi ken toki e ale kepeken toki pona. mi ken toki monsuta li ken toki suwi.

DAMNIT MCKENZIE (7/13/24)

mckenzie has finally updated their LTE only to IMMEDIATELY TAKE BACK 2ND PLACE! they finally updated the damn hub just to stay in damn second place! damn youu mckenzie!! i hope the holy pie god KILLS YOU IN YOUR SLEEP!!! so anyway, i have to write more now. that's great. truth be told, i haven't actualy read mckenzies entry yet.. i just got a discord message after i said "you can finally give me my second place" they were like "i wouldn't be too sure about that".. i knew they had reserves but i didn't know it'd be enough to immediately take back their spot.. also it's kinda funny knockton wrote so damn much that we're now fighting for second place. red is designing a website for their commissions (for their cool art that they draw (i will link it here if it ever exists)), and then we (i) will make the website! such cool. very text. long text, even. okay, so maybe.. i should read mckenzies entry. however, i think reading it before taking back second place is admitting defeat (ignore that i'm fighting for second place). hold on.. i just checked and i'm ahead again! take that mckenzie! hahahahahha! anyway, i'm gonna read ur entry now.

the hub has been updated and i've taken a celebratory screenshot (ignore that i'm on my phone). 2nd place babyyy!

uIsaKSyZvB (7/20/24)

"you know what might be fun?" she asked herself, referring to herself in the third person for no apparent reason, "making a disc- okay yea the third person stuff stops there i'm tired and this is a FAKE entry.. and by a fake entry i mean probably a more real entry than the rest because this one actually has a purpose. you see falcon updated their LTE (woo) (hence the weird keyboard smash title of this entry) and i was like "huh wait i have them added on discord.. hmm.. i've actually talked to multiple LTE'ers on discord.. maybe i should make a discord for.. this community.. i guess.. so i did. it's pretty barebones, and i honestly expect 100% of my readers to join.. except that 100% of my readers is still 1½ so.. yea not much hope there. anyway here is the invite:

https://discord.com/invite/hj8Z36NNbV

new lte? (the day after the last one)

NEW LTE? honestly, idk how we missed this one for *checks math* 4 months?!? it has the most obvious URL ever "thelongesttextever.neocities.org", i think this may be the reason we didn't notice it actually. it is very similar to the URL for the LTE hub "longesttextever.neocities.org" which may have contributed to it being overlooked for so long. anyway, i have contacted mckenzie and hopefully that shall be on the hub soon enough. it was last updated just a couple months ago, so it may still be active. if so: hello DFC454!

DFC454's Longest Text Ever
Length: ∼40,000 characters

dark version
Section I: welcome to the lte
Chapter 0: The Not So Grand Beginning
(3/22/24) Hello. What you are reading is going to be the most boring thing ever written. I don't even know what the point of this is, but what I do know is that 1: I have too much freetime. 2: Get ready for a loooong ride, my friend. Because this is going to be the longest wall of text on a simple HTML website you will have ever gazed your eyes upon. So buckle up, and get ready for a very long ride.

Chapter 1: Why Are You Here?
(3/22/24) So, you actually went to this website. Congrats, you get nothing. I bet you were searching for random Neocities websites because you have absolutely nothing better to do. I actually don't have anything better to do either, so I guess we both have too much freetime. Also, if you are wondering how long this is gonna be, I am not gonna tell you, just to make this a even more painful experience. I bet that my wrists and fingers are gonna be broken after this. I could continue typing onto this thing for days, weeks, or even months. I could still be updating this a YEAR from now. Okay. But seriously, why are you even here? You could just click off, or read another wall of text that's probably way better than mine. If you really want to read this, well, I can't stop you. So anyways, let's talk about something new. Something unexpected. Something bold and unique, also because this chapter is getting a little long (or short? i don't really know at this point) but anyways, here we go. Next chapter!

Chapter 2: Not the First
(3/22/24) This actually isn't the first time I have tried to write a "LTE" (longest text ever). This is the fourth attempt. Previous ones were just HTML files I never published to the web. The longest one was actually the second attempt, which PROBABLY had (don't quote me on this) 18 chapters, and over 30,000 characters. But here's the thing. I used copy and paste MORE THAN ONCE in that attempt, so it doesn't count. But this time, no more fooling around. No more copy and paste, just pure walls of text typed by my hands. The first attempt had only 5 chapters, and it was split into different files, so it wasn't really a "wall of text" like I want it to be. I want you to be able to scroll down for miles and miles, without ever reaching the end. Something so long, nobody will ever DARE to read everything inside it. Okay, so far, with the HTML code, this is currently around 3,230 characters long. I'm not gonna count the words, just characters. Hopefully Neocities doesn't crash while I'm trying to type on this. Now, I don't know if these should really be counted as chapters, but rather just paragraphs, because each one is kinda short. But whatever, I don't know what else to call them. Paragraphs just sounds weird. Okay, I have a question for you. If a cheese walked down sideways to the McDonalds, what would the value of "c" be? I'm just joking. That wasn't even a question, just complete gibberish. Is this getting long? I think it's getting long. Maybe, maybe not. I haven't viewed what the actual website looks like with this chapter in it yet. Also, if there is a bunch of typos in this, that's because it's 10:44 PM and I am tired and bored. I need sleep. Actually, I think it's time to move onto a new topic. I call it...

Chapter 3: The Gravy Incident
(3/22/24) So there was one time where I was waiting in the lunch line at school. On Thursdays, we normally have the nachos, which, let me tell you, the meat is disgusting. I don't know what they are putting in that "mystery meat", but my stomach does NOT WANT TO KNOW. So, I just get the mashed potatos with gravy. I sit down, eat, and notice something inside the gravy. At first, it was slimy, sticky, and was a big black blob. Me, being the idiot I was, ate the blob. I ended up vomiting a bunch of times even when I just thinked about it. I don't know what that was, but I am sure I don't want to know. And that's why I don't get the gravy from school anymore. That was a short chapter. Now, for this next part, I am going to tell you a story. "There once was a dude with an orange in his pocket. He carried it everywhere he went. Until one fateful day, in which that day was the day he ate the orange and died. The end. In loving memory of (GUY WHO DIED EATING ORANGE)." That certainly was an interesting story, huh? Anyways, next chapter!

Chapter 4: Other LTEs and Stuff
(3/23/24) So, there are actually multiple of these LTEs out there. There is one by someone named Kenneth (i think) and it is around 25,000 characters. Maybe. I don't really know, I might be wrong. Last time I looked at that LTE, it was a WHILE back. Anyways, there is another one by flamingchicken that is OVER 200,000 CHARACTERS LONG! Wow. That is very long. But what if I told you that there is a LTE like no other. One that is hundreds of thousands of characters long. One that is- okay, you get the point. And that LTE goes to... Knockton! With a whopping 572,168 characters, this is quite possibly the longest out of all the Longest Text Evers. It could even be longer than the bible. But who knows. There could be a very obscure and unknown LTE out there, still active to this day. It could be even longer than everything we have ever laid our eyes upon. It could be the actual Longest Text Ever. Now, I am not trying to get a world record here but- oh, who am I kidding, that's the whole point of this- I mean- I, um, uhhhh... yeah. Here's an interesting fact. If you were to type something like this at 1 character per second nonstop, you would beat the record in around a week. Since there are 86,400 seconds in a day, if we were to switch that to 1 character per second, we would get the same amount. 86,400 times 7 equals 604,800. 604,800 is greater than 572,168. And finally- okay, enough of the math stuff. I think it's almost time to go onto a new chapter. So, before we move on, let's read another story. "There once was a boy named George. George one day decided to be so dumb, he licked a toilet seat. 5 days later, he was in the ER, laying down. The end." ...Well, that escalated quickly.

Chapter 5: Chapter Name Here
(3/23/24) Okay, before you ask, yes, the title is intentional. I had no ideas whatsoever so just went with this. Let's see what things my smooth brain can think of while typing this. Also, if you remember when this was in Arial text font and had a white background, you are a legend. Welp, it's 9:39 PM, and I have nothing better to do, so why not play some games? How about... hmm... maybe Rock, Paper, Scissors? No, no, that won't work... Okay. I have an idea. Guess the number I am thinking of. Hint, it's on a scale from -942.3 to 495,244,023.589. Did you guess? Well it was -942.4. I purposfully picked a lower number than the scale so I could trick you. Alright, well here's an advertisement for no reason: Get unlimited phone free cellular free data plan plus ultimate for only $799.39 a month! This was an advertisement by g-mobil. Okay, what should I talk about next... I know! A quiz. First question: What is the square root of -1? Answer: Imaginary value! Second question: What is the time as I am typing this? Answer: 9:45 PM! Last question: What is the mathematical sum of addend "1" and addend "1"? Answer: 11! Okay, enough of that, it's getting boring. This whole chapter is boring. I couldn't even think of a good name for it. This isn't creative. This isn't artwork. It's just a meaningless wall of text. But I won't let that stop me. I will continue typing until I DIE- Okay, maybe not until I die, but I could add onto this for the next month or so. Well, what should we do now? I don't really know, I have completely ran out of ideas... Oh, wait! There still is one thing I haven't talked about on this yet... The length of the document! Let's see... after copying and pasting the contents of the actual website into Notepad++, I can see that there is around almost 8,000 characters on this LTE. Okay, NOW we are getting somewhere. I've just realized something. These chapters are really short... maybe I could just make this one really long? I guess if I want to sacrifice my fingers, then I can... Okay wrists, get ready for the most painful 3 hours of your life! What if I actually break my fingers from typing too much? Is it possible? I don't know. I could Google it. Okay, I Googled it, and no, you may not break your fingers but you can cause severe injuries to the bones or tissue (at least i think). As I am typing onto the LTE, this site currently has 23 views. So thanks those 23 people who found my website. You win NOTHING. Mainly because I don't have anything to give you. Sorry about that. Actually, some of those 23 views could just be the same people checking for updates. Well, guess what? There's been quite a few updates, including a whole style change, so you've got some catching up to do. I honestly don't know why you are even still here. There is literally no point of reading this, unless you have too much spare time and just wanna waste it on some crap website. Well, anyways, I am already typing onto this, so might as well continue. Okay, but this is actually getting a little long. I wonder if I can get this chapter to fill up the whole page. Maybe, maybe not. But it's worth the shot. Okay, so new challenge. Try to keep this chapter going as long as possible. I hope I don't end up running out of ideas before I even get to the next chapter since I am doing this. Eh, should be fine though. Actually... you know what? I have changed my mind. I don't want this to be a long chapter. Just long enough so it can even be classified as a chapter. The previous ones probably aren't even chapters, just short paragraphs. But not this one. I shall continue until the chapter fills up the entire page, I shall continue until- Welp, I am getting bored so I might work on this another time. So... buh-bye.

Section II: uhhh
Chapter 6: A Milestone
(3/23/24) Well, well, well. We are close to hitting 10,000 characters in this monstrosity. Wait for it... BOOM! 10,000 characters and counting on this LTE. Nice. Anyways, considering the fact that the only thing I am probably gonna do here is celebrate hitting 10,000 characters, this may be a very short chapter. So far, it is a very, VERY short chapter. This is nothing compared to Chapter 5. I must find a way to continue this chapter... Dang, if only I could count how many words were in this LTE... Well, anyways, that was a short-lived celebration. Cya!

Chapter 7: Random Stuff
(3/24/24) It is the third day. Just woke up, remembered the LTE I had, and now have decided to edit it again. The website now has 28 views, so thank you those 5 extra people. Also, you may have noticed the counter at the bot10m of the site. It is more than the view counter. Well, it is NOT a view counter, but rather a hit counter. You may know this if you've used Neocities before, but the hit counter goes up every time the servers send a file. Also, part of the reason the hit counter is higher than the view one is because almost half of those were me refreshing the page to see how it looked. Anyways, we now have 11,111 characters in this LTE. That's a cool number. That's 5 ones. Okay, I'll stop... You know what? I dare you to try and find the number "10" inside this LTE. Hint: It is before this text. ;) Also, I probably should mention something. My online username is actually DFC454. I will change the title later to say "DFC454's LTE". On the list of LTEs (longesttextever.neocities.org), The shortest LTE only has 12,734 characters, which is by BusterDdog and the LTE is titled "BusterDdog's Kinda Boring Life". Copy the link if you wanna look at it: (busterddogskindaboringlife.neocities.org). Well, I am about to beat that character amount, because I am now at 11,767 characters! Just 1,000 more to go! Well, now what should I talk about? Hmm...

Chapter 8: The Point of This Thing
(3/24/24) So, I don't think I have told you what the point of this LTE is. Well, what I am trying to do, is make the longest wall of text ever, and my goal for characters is... 12 million- just joking. I don't really have a goal for this, just trying to type as much as I can. This is sort of just a blog for stuff that happens in my life. Or whatever weird rants I can talk about. Or maybe just random stuff. I just ate some popcorn. Like that. Mmm, doritos. Or that. Okay, okay, I'm done. I am suprised you managed to get this far into the future "Longest Text Ever". You must be reeeallly bored by now. Why don't you go outside or something? You could do so much stuff other than reading this. Oh, whatever. I can't stop you, but what I can do, is make up a really boring story that might just make you go away. Let's begin. "There once was a dude who had a magic thermostat. He could turn it up to any temperature he wanted. First, he turned it to 20 degrees (Fahrenheit). He slowly started turning into a block of ice, so he quickly changed the temperature to 150 degrees. He started melting, but his fingers were too liquidy to set the thermostat to a different temperature. So, he died. The end." Truly a sad story. I will never forget that man. Wait, what was I just talking about? Never mind that, let's talk about the Flaming Chicken LTE. It is 203,941 characters long. Here's an interesting fact: Flaming Chicken's LTE started 20 years ago. ended 19 years ago. Time truly flies... But anyways, here's more facts! Did you know that the oldest LTE (i think) is... Hermnerp's LTE at a whopping 230,634 characters, this LTE started on January 19th, 2004! Cool, right? Well, anyways, let's check the length of this... Almost 14,000 characters. Or, exactly 13,830 characters. That puts us at 3rd shortest LTE on longesttextever.neocities.org (THAT IS A DIFFERENT WEBSITE THAN THIS ONE). Now, just around 400 more characters to pass the Textra LTE. Let's check the view counter... Uhh... why is this getting attention? I have 38 views on this website now. Well, thank you extra 10 people that want to look at my website for some reason. You get nothing. Air. Pure nothingness. Not an atom of anything.

Chapter 9: Length
(3/25/24) Here's a interesting fact you may already know: One character is approximately equal to one byte of data. So, since there is around 14,000 characters so far, we can change those to bytes and it is... the same number. 14,000. One kilobyte is around 1,000 bytes. 14,000 divided by 1,000 is 14. So... if I am correct, we should be at 14 KB (kilobytes) so far. [8:52] Okay. Seriously. Where are you coming from. I now have over 80 views. Thank you- wait, let me do the math real quick... 81 minus 38... carry the one... Thank you extra 43 people who visited my website. You get... can you guess? Can you? Come on. Guess! Okay, fine. I will tell you. Your reward is... absolutely nothing! I have really don't have anything to give you, so I will give you some air. Breathe it while it's still... umm... not polluted. Well, now we are almost at 15,000 characters, so I think it's time to celebrate. WOO, YEAH!!!!!- Okay, that's enough. Now, I will officially reveal the word count. It is... 2,809 words! Wow, amazing. Not as much as I was hoping.

Chapter 10: Double Digits
(3/27/24) I missed a day. Oh well. Nothing much. Guess what? We are now in the double digits of the chapters in The Longest Text Ever! This actually isn't the longest text ever YET, but it will be soon. Very soon. Very, very soon- Okay, fine, maybe not SOON, but eventually. I also noticed I am updating this a lot less frequently now. I am kinda running out of ideas, so I really don't know what to write about. Anyways, I am going to count for absolutely no reason, just because I can. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eightteen, nineteen, twenty. I am bored. (3/28/24) I bet you haven't seen a chapter here be edited on two seperate days yet. That's because it only just has. Try our all new Phone Plus Cellular Phone Plan Ultimate Unlimited Master Lite at 497 dollars a month! From G-Mobl. *g-mobol jingle jangle plays* I have no idea what to write so expect some more weird crap like that every now and then. This chapter is a little short, so let's spice things up a bit. I will tell a story. "There once was a kid named "Name". All the kids in his class laughed and made fun of him because of his name. And they all realized that they had stupid names too. Like "Six", or "Guy". So they couldn't make fun of him anymore. The end." That... did not spice things up at all. That was just boring. Well, anyway, I have to go now. See ya in a bit.

Chapter 11: Please Universe, Give Me An Idea
(3/28/24) Here's a fun fact: The most used letter in this LTE is E. The second is T, and then O, A, and I. Found this from a letter density calculator. There is now 1,455 Es in this LTE. That's a lot of Es. In fact, 11% of this page is made out of E. This is truly an E moment. Truly astonishing. In all my life, I have never seen such a grand display of the 5th letter of the English lexicon. Truly a moment to take in. Just let it sink in for a moment. Breathe in, breathe out. Thank you for taking breathing exercises with me. Thank you, and goodnight- okay, this is getting boring. Fun fact: if this page was a PDF, it would only have 5 pages. That's... not a lot. We need more. More I say, MORE! MOOORRREEE!!! EVEN MORE! I NEED THE MOST MORE I CAN GET- Actually, that sentence doesn't even make sense, but eh, whatever. (3/29/24) I am back. With nothing to write about. I am not that creative with finding things to write. Also, if you haven't noticed, these chapter things? They are actually something I came up with to divide this into sections to make the LTE easier to read. If you look at other LTEs, you may noticed they don't have "chapters" unlike this one. I just want to make it easier to read and find where you were. But, we are about to hit 18,000 characters! That is... I guess it's a lot. Quite a bit, but not a BIG amount. This actually has 3,371 words now. And now we have reached 18,000 characters. Truly a moment to take in. Just let it sink in for a moment. Truly an intruging and astonishing moment. Amazing. Quite utterly amazing- Okay, fine, i'll stop... I actually wonder how many typos I have made inside this. Let's check. [7:41] So, I tried putting this in one spell checker and it didn't work. It took too long, so I will try another one. Let's see what happens. It says 250 errors. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY. I can't believe this. Am I really that bad at writing? Well, I'm not suprised, writing wasn't really my big thing anyway. I'm more into mathematics or science. History is a little interesting, but sometimes it just... meh. You don't have to agree with me on these things, they are just my opinions. Well, I have to go somewhere AGAIN, so I will see you... in a little bit. Goodbye!

Section III: The Orange Man's Revival
Chapter 12: What If...
(3/30/24) My brain has produced an idea. What if, I were to print this out? How many pages would it make? I have the PDF file, and it's literally only 5 pages. That's nothing. I need more. THE MOST I CAN GET- Okay, we've done this before. That idea reminds me of something. One time when I was trying to set up my new printer, which is a HAITCH PEA (hp) brand, the app which I was trying to link the printer to was being so stubborn, it took like 20 minutes. I was pretty tired at the time too, so there's a possibility I was just tired and messing with the wrong things. The next LTE we have to surpass is... Kenneth Iman's LTE. it is 21,425 characters, and this LTE has... wait... let me see... It is almost 19,600 characters long- Oh, wait. My mistake, we are now OVER 19,600 characters. Sorry about that. We are almost at 20,000 characters! Now we are getting somewhere. The character counter I am using actually has a thing where you can view an estimate of how many pages there are in the document you have loaded/pasted. Let's look at what the Word Counter says. There are 3,732 words, 20,000 characters, 359 sentences, 8.3 pages, and the speaking time is... 20 minutes. So, if you were to read this out loud, it would only take 20 minutes. I am disappointed. All this hard work, just for 20 minutes. 20 minutes of speaking time. This is outrageous! I cannot believe this. You know what? I refuse to accept this. This cannot be real- okay, that's enough, but we have finally hit 20,000 characters! Yippee! Hooray! Wowzers! Yikes! Amazing! Intruging! Astounding! Astonishing! Cool, though. And we are about to surpass Kenneth's LTE. We are at a whopping 20,564 characters! Only around 900 more characters to go! But one more thing, thank you people who have actually read this thing. I wouldn't think people would take the time to read something as stupid as this, so thank you for looking at my kinda useless website.

Chapter 13: Neocities AI?
(3/31/24) Well, now there's a new feature on Neocities I guess. There was this AI chat window thing that popped up when I opened up the HTML file to edit it. It's the bot named "Daria", and boy does the AI think I suck. I won't lie on that one, the bot is right. I don't know if this was a April Fools prank or what, but on my side, it isn't April Fools Day yet, so I don't know if this is here to stay or not. Anyways, my honest opinion if this ends up staying on Neocities, I really don't want some AI crap like this. I just want to edit my website the way I want. Also, it seems to really hate my website judging from the fact that it's calling my website a "trainwreck" and "mess". That could be true. Okay, is true. And for some reason, The AI thought I was putting everything in divs. The only thing in a div is the hit counter at the bottom of the website. I've looked on the subreddit for answers, but apparently this is VERY new because I saw posts from 20 minutes ago talking about this new bot "assistant". If this is an April Fool's joke, I just hope it's not gonna stay here on Neocities. But anyways, see you another time I guess.

Chapter 14: I Have Returned
(4/26/24) Sooooooo, yeah, I am back. I was gone for a while because I was working on some stuff, but now I have returned to continue adding onto this. I forgot how many words and characters were in this, so let's find out. Well diddly dang on a rubbly blang. I am at 22,000+ characters and 4,139 words. Now let's sing the words song! Words, words, words. How many words can you see? 10? 100? 1,000? No, it's approximately four thousand, one hundred and fifty words! Words, words, words- I am never doing that again. Anyways, a little bit about myself because I forgot to mention it before, I make music sometimes, make animations, and programming. Languages I know are Python, C#, and Java (still learning). Looking at the word counter, and it says the amount of pages is around 9. Only nine? Well, I guess I have to keep typing. There is an new experimental option that shows how long it would take if it was hand written, And the hand written time, is... 5 hours and 26 minutes. That's a long time. Now I am wondering the total amount of time I have typed this for... Maybe a few hours? Either way, 5 and a half hours is a LONG time. When I am finally done adding onto this, I wonder how long the LTE would be if I printed it out and made a book with it. Also, it has been over 1 month since I started this! 1 month and 4 days, to be exact. So that means, sadly, I missed the one month anniversary. This is truly a sad moment for all of us. Well, anyways, I have to go soon, so one more thing. The Blue gatorade

Chapter 15: An Unfortunate Turn of Events
(4/29/24) Unfortunately, I will not be able to edit this as much, because guess what? My computer broke. How did it break? Well, the mouse I was using got tangled up behind the computer, so when I moved it a little too far, it fell, and hit the floor. So now the screen is broken and now it's going to be a few weeks for it to get fixed. The way I am editing this right now is using my school laptop (don't judge me), So, yeah. Just a quick little update. And just remember, to always Kool-Aid Jammers

Chapter 16: This Is The 16th Chapter
(4/29/24) Yep, you read that right. This is the 16th chapter. Amazing. Semi-Interesting Fact: 16 is a power of 2. For example, 2^1 is 2, 2^2 is 4, 2^3 is 8, and 2^4 is 16. If we were to go higher, we could reach numbers in the millions quite fast. At only 2^32, the value is two billion, one hundred forty-seven million, four hundred eighty-three thousand, six hundred forty-seven. In standard form, that would be 2,147,483,648. Semi-Interesting Fact #2: 2^32 - 1 is the 32-bit integer limit. However, web languages like JavaScript can reach numbers up to 1e308, or 10^307. That is over a uncentillion. Numbers are quite fascinating, no? Anyways, enough of "Semi-Interesting Facts", let's move on to an actual topic. Now where was I... Oh, right. The chapter number. Semi-Interesting Fact #3: Bananas are yellow. They also emit radiation from all the potassium inside them. Don't quote me on that, I might have gotten a few things wrong. Semi-Interesting Fact #4: On the periodic table, Element Potassium is labeled "K". Strange, but I'm sure it was for a reason. Right? Honestly, I don't know that much stuff about chemistry. I'm more into mathematics. Wait. Dang it, I went off topic again. Semi-Interesting Fact #5: In the chemical formula of water, H2O does not mean one Hydrogen atom and two Oxygen atoms, instead it would be two Hydrogen atoms and one Oxygen atom. Semi-Interesting Fact #6: If you have 2 oxygen atoms and 2 hydrogen atoms, that would create Hydrogen Peroxide, which is an irritant to the eyes, nose, skin, and throat. Okay, I think I am done now. Enough of those semi-interesting facts, now it is time for INTERESTING FACTS- no. I am never saying that again. Ok goodbye CHeese

Section IV: The Cubing Saga
Chapter 17: A(nother) Milestone
(4/29/24) I have just achieved an amazing achievement. That's four words that start with the first letter in the English lexicon. This letter is "A". We are have just hit 26,000 characters! Hooray. Alright, off-topic, but... I used to have a laptop on which I made the first LTE I ever made. This LTE had 28 chapters, 10 hour hand writing time, almost 40,000 characters, and over 7,000 words. It took a while to find the file because my desktop was so cluttered up, but I eventually found it in File Explorer. I am going to try and beat that. Also I have moved up a place on the LTE list. I am not actually on it yet, but I just compared the character counts. My next opponent has over 50,000 characters, so I am going to need to type a lot. And I mean a LOT. Just to remind you, I am only around halfway to 50,000 characters. My wrist hurts. Anyway, we are now past 26,000 characters. That was a very short-lived celebration. If you want the current exact character count, it is 26,825 characters, which is almost 27,000! Yay, anyways, I have to go buh bye The Funy Plan

Chapter 18: Cubing
(4/30/24) I use Rubik's Cubes now. As of right now I have been trying to solve one, I have not yet actually done one though. I have followed the steps of white cross, second layer so far, but it's the yellow cross that always throws me off. The weird thing is that on the first attempt on yellow cross, I got a hook shape on the yellow side, so I tried to follow the steps to solve the yellow cross, but I somehow ended up rescrambling it again. After, when I got to the yellow cross step AGAIN, the shape I got wasn't listed. My cube MIGHT be unsolvabale. Sad. Okay, it's later in the day now, and never mind, it is solvable. I still haven't solved it yet, but at least it isn't unsolvable, so I have a chance to solve it once and for all. I have said the word "solve" a lot of times now. I mean, the objective of the cube is to SOLVE it, so I guess it's normal to say solve. Solve, solve, solve, solve- Okay, I am done. Man, that's a tongue-twister. Anyways, just thought I would tell you about something new I do now. I have been practicing a LOT, and it is very frustrating, but if you ever do this, I am sure that eventually, you can solve your first cube. Goodnight everybody have a good April 50th

Chapter 19: Cubing (Part 2)
(5/2/24) I finally did it. I have solved my first Rubik's Cube. I actually solved it 3 times. I have remembered most of the algorithms, and I finally did it! What I am going to do next, is solve it as fast as I possibly can. That is called speed-cubing. My personal best is... 10 minutes. It is not that fast at all, but I am working on it. Man, this is getting very long now. Let's check how many characters and words this thing has now. As of right when I am typing this, the character count is over 28,600 characters. Oh, and if you want to know how many words it has, it's over 5,350. So many words, how many words can you see? 1 word? 5 words? 10 words? 200 words? 3,582 words? No, you are wrong. It is around five thousand, and four hundred. In standard form, it is 5,400, but in expanded form, it is (5 * 1,000) + (4 * 100). Okay, enough of numbers, back to the Rubik's Cubes. If you are wondering what brand my cube is, it's a GAN356 M. M means magnetic. It turns pretty well, I really like it. The cube was around 20 dollars, but it was worth it. By the way, the method I use is the CFOP method. Steps that were in the video I watched was: Form a daisy by inserting white edges onto the bottom layer. Then, match the white edges other color with the color in the center, then flip that side to the top layer (white center), and keep repeating that for all white edges. Then, solve the white corners, then solve second layer. Make a yellow cross, and match the edges with center colors, solve corners, then there you have it, a solved cube! That was long. But anyways, I don't think I have anything left to talk about, so I will see you another time. Goodbye, and see you in the next chapter whenever I update this again.

Chapter 20: The Oldest LTE
(5/2/24) You may not be wondering, "What is the oldest LTE on the internet?". Well, today I am here to answer that question that probably nobody has ever thought of. So, let's look at a list of known LTEs. Let's start off with Hermnerp. In the Hermnerp LTE, it starts off with text saying "1-19-04". It is a date (obviously). That date is January 19th, 2004. If we read more, we can see that it is inspired by flamingchicken's LTE. Let's go to another one. Actually, there are not that many old ones... But, since Hermnerp's LTE was inspired by flamingchicken's LTE, we can safely say that flamingchicken's longest text ever thingy MIGHT just be the oldest and first ever LTE on the internet. It was started around very early 2004, and Hermnerp's LTE was started on 1-19-04. This means that flamingchicken's LTE was started somewhere between January 1, 2004, and January 18th, 2004 (before Hermnerp's LTE). Any dates above January 15th are most likely to not be the date, because Hermnerp would have to set up their website and everything to make the LTE. So, we can conclude that flamingchicken's LTE was started around January 1, 2004, to January 14th, 2004. Here's the thing though. Would YOU make something like an LTE on New Year's Day? Or would you celebrate New Year's Day like a normal person? Most likely the second option. So, we can safely rule out January 1st. That leaves us with January 2, 2004, to January 14, 2004. Now, I could be wrong about this. This is just a theory. A LTE THEORY- no. I hope you enjoyed my little theory on the oldest LTE on the internet. Goodbye now. Okay, you can leave now. Leave. Get out. GO AWAY

Chapter 21: Cubing (Part 3)
(5/3/24) Hello again. I have a new personal best at solving the Rubik's Cube. It is... 4 minutes and 31 seconds. Still not that fast. I want to find methods that would make it faster, but it's going to take a while. Anyways, just thought I would share that with you. This is a very short chapter. I want to make it longer... Hmm... Yeah, I don't really know what else to put, so this might be the new shortest chapter in my LTE. Random Fact #1: I have solved the rubik kube over 10 time Yeah okay Bye bye

Section V: the funny
Chapter 22: DFC454's LTE Official Terms of Service For No Reason
(5/8/24) Hello, once again. This isn't actually the first version of the DLTEOTOSFNR. I had made one version earlier, but it just looked funny and I didn't think it would work out. So here we are. How do you even make one of these things? I know Terms Of Service things are known to be pretty long. You know, now I am wondering who types those things? Do people really type so much stuff only for it to just be ignored and skipping all the way to the end- Oh, right. The DLTEOTOSFNR. Well, time to type and maybe break my wrists. By, um, agreeing to this, you agree to, um... eat five hundred cookies. Actually, you might get diabetes from that- anyway, section 2: By accepting the funny DFC454's LTE Terms Of Service, you hereby agree to.. um... yeah, I have no idea why I am still doing this. What do I even write in these things? Hmm... Wait, I just got an idea completely unrelated to anything in this chapter. What if I split chapters into groups, like sections? It would probably be easier to see where you are at (even though I don't think anybody is ever going to read this whole thing), and I just think it would be a good divider. [later] Okay, so I ended up adding it. Vote for the next section title: A: "What ? oh", B: "THE BEST SECTION", or C: "this is the sixth section". Choose wisely. Thank you for voting, we will not take your vote into consideration. And the winner of the 2-hourly-section-name-picking-thing voting is... Option C! With approximately 0 votes. Unrelated topic, but I am very close to getting less than a minute on solving the Rubik's Cube. My personal best is currently 1 minute 4 seconds! So close. But anyways, I have said the word "anyways" a lot of timesin this LTE. It's almost like every chapter has the word "anyways" in it. Actually, come to think of it, I think every chapter actually does have the word "anyways" in it. What a fascinating fact. This has been Fascinating Facts, with DFC454. Now let's check the character count. Drumroll, please. badadadadadadadaaddadada- PSHHHHH! Over 34,300 characters. And around 6,400 words. Amazing. What if, I printed this whole thing out? I wonder how many pages it would be... 5? 10? 20? Let's check. [later again] okay so i checked the page count and it says 14.2 pages. I need more pages. What about, I save it as a PDF, and go from there? The page counter on the website I am using might not be so accurate, so let's try it. [later once again] ELEVEN. Only eleven pages. Have you ever wondered what is the longest chapter in this LTE? You have probably never asked yourself this question, but I don't care, so let's find out. The longest chapter, is Chapter 5, which fills up a whole page in the PDF. What's funny, is that this chapter is actualyl getting very close to Chapter 5's length. It's time to dethrone Chapter 5 once and for all. But what would I write? It's easy. Just spam a bunch of characters in- no. Instead, I will count to 10, and see where that gets me. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That didn't do anything. Now there's just numbers in the middle of the chapter. Let's see how much this chapter fills up now. Hopefully there is more pages too... [later once again AGAIN] It actually almost fills up the entire page. Now this chapter is about to fill up my entire screen. Maybe not yours, it might only be halfway there. But for me in the Neocities code editor, it DOES almost fill up the entire page- okay, you get the point. There is a hidden reference to another LTE in this chapter. It has to do with a drumroll. And the LTE it is referencing to has to do with a rainbow sheep. I am now going to tell a random story I came up with. There once was a factory.. The power grid broke, and the power went out. What an unfortunate turn of events. Well, I have to go now. I will add more to this chapter later, but for now, goodbye. Cheese is melting in the fries (5/9/24) Hello. I am back. But, I need to go very soon because I have a test. That's great. Little update, but we have over 36,000 characters in the LTE now! Alrighty, now I REALLY have to go now. Goodbye. [later once again once again] So, I have finished the test, but now I have to go AGAIN. Doing something in class right now. I am super lucky the school hasn't blocked Neocities yet. Knockton's Potato LTE isn't even blocked. It contains a bit of profanities. I guess I'm just lucky. Anyways, gotta go now AGAIN. See you in a few hours. Buh bye. [later once again- im not doing this anymore] Hello, once again. I am back, with a story to tell. It was about a... bell. "once upon a time, there was a bell. the bell was bored of doing the same thing over and over again. they thought to themself, "i hate my life" and indeed it was true. but one day, they got stuck, like something in a pile of glue. im really bad at rhyming, especially the timing, but now I am done with this story, and i do not hope to see you in the next... uh... story." I don't like that story. It has very bad rhyming- wait i wrote it- what if I kept writing in this same chapter? Wait, but there would be no point to even putting chapters... Anyhoo, yes I didn't say anyway for literally the first time ever, but now it is time for me to go again. I'm mainly just tired. Actually, lets check the character counter before I leave. Remember how I said, at 8,000 characters, "NOW we are getting somewhere."? You probably don't, but I am going to say it right after I reveal the character count... once again. [laterAAAAAAAAAAAA] just realized theres a typo in the date whoops [OK NOW THE CHARACTER REVEAL] As I am typing this, the amount of characters and words is... 7,082 words, and 37,830 characters. NOW we are getting somewhere. Told you I would say it. I think this chapter is almost like a 6th of this entire LTE. As of right now, of course. Ah, now I remember the days of when this LTE only had around 3 chapters. Back when it was all new, it didn't have the Verdana font. Honestly, I should really make a dark version of this. It wouldn't make your eyes burn. Now I hope no one was looking at Neocities websites and stumbled across this one. This chapter is getting really close to filling up my entire screen. What was this chapter even about anyway? Oh right, the D.L.T.E.O.T.O.S.F.N.R. That's too long for an acronym. But now, this chapter has filled up my entire screen! Maybe it has filled up yours? Time to find out by looking at the page AGAIN. I looked at it, and yes, it does fill up the entire screen. Did you know? The letter "z" has only been used 14 times in this LTE, including this use. So fascinating. [latuh] okay so i put more into this chapter but it didnt save whoops so you will never see it EVER

Chapter 23: The LTE In Python
(5/10/24) So, I recently made something in Python. It uses the requests module, so I can grab stuff from websites. Can you guess what I used it for? Well, I just made a text file containing all of this LTE and grabbed it using requests, and it worked. Here's the thing though. I had to copy a BUNCH of modules to the path of the Python file. The reason? Python couldn't find the modules. I was too lazy to change the path it was looking in, so I just copied it to the file's location. Just a little test with Python. I hadn't used it in quite a bit, so why not make something? I actually remember making this probability/luck game in Python a while back... that was like MONTHS ago though. Wait a minute. I just got an idea. What if there was an LTE, that was constructed by... anyone? Anyone could add onto it, say what's on their mind... Now I want to make something like that... and just how big could it grow? Could be a fun little experiment. You know what? I am going to make that thought become a reality. Where you, the reader, can make your own part of an LTE alongside other people. Just a little thought I has. But anyway, I will see you soon. Buh bye. Again.

Chapter 24: The Milestone Of All Time
(5/11/24) It has been nearly 2 months since I started this LTE. Now I have reached 40,000 characters, and over 7,500 words. I did it before May 22, 2024, the 2 month anniversary of this LTE. Yippeeeeee! Hooray yay! Well, now that I have done that, I only have around 15,000 characters until I reach the next place in the list of LTEs. Now I wonder if I am ever going to reach 100,000 characters before I actually stop working on this (which might not happen in a WHILE)... I guess it's possible, I mean, you see some pretty long LTEs out there like the Pinkish Pickle LTE, flamingchicken, and more. Shoutout to all of those people. Their LTEs pretty much inspired me to create this thing. About that "lte that everyone can add onto" idea, I might make one soon. If I ever start that project, I will add my email you can send your entries to. Just a cool little milestone I wanted to talk about. Oh, and today the laptop is ready. Going to go get that soon. I am actually editing this on my old laptop. It's not a very good one, I just mainly use it for things that don't require high performance. Just thought I would share some stuff with you all. See you on the 50,000 character mark. And maybe 10,000 word mark. Farewell.

Chapter 25: Quarter to 100
(5/14/24) Been a few days, so why not add onto this again? Oh, and I added a favicon to the site finally. Also, I have recently gotten Team Fortress 2 (tf2). It's pretty fun, although bots infest quite a few servers. Every once in a while you don't see that many bots on servers, but hey, there's nothing we can really do until Valve recognizes that people enjoy this game and want to see more updates. It's been nearly 8 years (i think) since the last major update. I do kinda suck, but I mean, I just started playing. That's kinda how it is for everyone, unless you've had experience with other FPS games.

GOSH!! eh heh eh heh YES HAW! lol This is sad Al's LTE so far is longer then mine AND I didn't even count that her font was smaller, I'm embarassed..thats really sad lol. My life is just boring and I have nothing to say I don't know why I bother doing this anyway no one will read it probably..except Al and she might get bored and quit lol. You know I really love getting emails, and little notes too, don't they just brighten your day?!?!

Listenin' to music...^^lalala ladeda^^ fun de fun fun! argh can't wait til the weekend!! lol and the week hasn't even started! ^^I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons, finally content with the past I regret. I found you find strength in your moments of weakness. For once I'm at peace with myself. I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long. I'm movin' on. I've lived in this place and I know all the faces. Each one is different but they're always the same. They mean me no harm but it's time that I face it, they'll never allow me to change. But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong. I'm moving on.^^ hum that reminds me of the Stephanie thing a little --grr made me MAD.^^At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me, and I know there's no guarantees, but I'm not alone. There comes a time in everyone's life, when all you can see are the years passing by, and I've made up my mind that those days are gone...^^ 1*20*04 and now for the little kiddies out there..a STORY! ~This is about a little midget man's adventure! (no offense to any midgets). A little midget man sat under a bridge. "Oh no! Oh no!" said a frog in the creek. "The evil troll is going to come and bite off your ears!" he told the little midget man. "Whaaat?!? froggy, froggy, froggy you're obviously mental -trolls do NOT exist! It's all your imagination." said little midget man. Then from the forest came a big ugly troll stomping through the grass. His hair was green and his eyes were red. He had humongous feet - longer then his arms! "ARRRGH!" he roared. "Who is under my bridge!!!?!? I CAN HEAR YOU!!!" "oh no! I told you there was a troll! I told you!!!" squealed the little froggy. The little midget man said calmly "No problem!" he pushed a button on his coat and wooosh! Jet pack! The blue fire spurted out of the bottom of the pack in two long flames. The little midget man flew into the sky. He was going all over, circling, circling, circling. While in the sky he ran into a pretty bluebird. The bluebird yelled "Ahh! Watch where you're going!!" They rammed into each other and came tumbling down into the woods.--thats as far as I got sorry kiddies lol. I wrote it today 4th period in English. She said just write whatever comes to your head, yep thats what came to my head...you're jealous eh? wish ya had my HEAD DONTCHA!!! don't lie...LIAR!New classes for the semester today -hah schedule change, and I got tons of hwk...geez teachers sheezer louiser.

Til the sun comes out and shines again, smile, give me reason to keep believin' that everything ain't misleading and I kiss the clouds on rainy days and smile for you when the skies are gray babe. Cuz I'm a teardrop away from crying and a few shots away from dying, dear Lord would you shower my pain, let it rain, let it rain on me while I cherish the air I breathe. I'm an angel that can't soar, can't fly, and I've mastered it, Lord knows why.^^ I love the rain...<3*<3*<3*<3*:D :D :D 11*21*04 What's his name?? What's his name?? Rosco?? huh..I have a friend who has a dog named Rosco...actually I have 2 FRIENDS whose dogs are named Rosco! hah wow, Rosco is his name right? what?? whaaat?? Rascal??? like the Little Rascals??? ooh THATS his name? what are you laughing at?? WHATS SO FUNNY!??! Rusty?? whaat? I thought his name was Rascal!! WHAT IS HIS NAME?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! AHHHHH!!!!!!!lol okay anyway (hah that was funny today at lunch heh heh heh) SOOOooOooOOOoOoOOOOoooooO I've just been adding to my picture collection tonight. I go on google click on images and look up stuff that I think is cool. Josh and I have both been looking for pictures of lightning, they're pretty cool. There are some where the sky is bright red it's awesome. I looked for some stuff about Colorado too (WHERE I WANNA MOVE!!:D) hehe but all to no avail, for I found no information.. boohoo..I never find information about Colorado. I gotta write a boooring business letter for eng. strat so I'm gonna see if I can find a cool college in Colorado that I can write too for information..hehe.

The only thing I can do in this place is going bowling or see a movie thats about it in winter at least. In summer you can walk around all over like to 5 points and get some fortune cookies yeah 10 cents each. It's pretty fun actually, I enjoy it. I'm sort of easily amused I'd say though because just sitting in my room staring at the wall was funny makes me start cracking up just sittng there. Tell myself a joke and hah it's funny I laugh. lol. ^^You mighta heard I run with a dangerous crowd. We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud. We might be laughing a bit too loud, aw but that never hurt no one.^^ohohohoh^^Your mother told ya all that I could give you was a reputation. aww she never cared for me, but did she ever say a prayer for me ohohohoh^^ arrooo ROOOF whoo whoo whoo whoo WHOO haven't ate barely anything today sheez I need a mt.dew, mmm ahh thats good me & Al have a SPECIAL Mt.Dew (that is currently in MY possession MWAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH!) ever since the exorcist-dang been a long time...SHEEZ. hum just named the 4 golden retrievers on my mousepad Ricky, Leo, Jazz and Jag. cool eh? lol MAN I'm bored!

Tina keeps givin me flower kiss candies man those are really good! most people haven't had any but yeah dude they're good. I have lots of the wrappers all over my desk here because yeah I just keep them and glue them to stuff sometimes lol. Today I thought about counting all the stickers on my sticker door but never got around to it..eh I have tried before but I always lose count..it's hard.I'm gonna make an estimate at like 700 or 800 cuz I really don't know. Mt.Dew is easier to chug when it's warm. 1*26*04 HEEEYA! I have a sad away message that someone at intyjunk wrote and I liked it so I had to shorten it to fit into an away message and make one. YEP! Hey just want to tell anyone who got this far to read this in my LTE and would like to comment to send me an email even if it's an angry you're a retard who is rambling for no reason whatsoever and just taking up precious air on this planet e-mail I'd still be very greatful for you sending :D :D :D you see this is because I do not receive emails very often and get very excited just to get them..so yeah you know my email down at the bottom of the page -don't hesitate JUST DO IT. Birty Birty Birty!!! Tigah Tigah Tigah!!! you're clothes are RED!!!! MWAHAHAHHA you're clothes are BLACK!!! MWAHAHAHAHAHAH!! I love that movie! hwahaaaaah even though I only saw it once..dude I'm poor I need money for a bunch of stuff right now and I don't have it..lol. ya know important stuff like Gala and to go to the movies and to buy that Birty Tigah movie! arr! ^^Vacation all I ever wanted! Vacation have to get away! Vacation wish it would never end! yeeaaah!^^ I always sing songs on this thinger.. a lot...lots lots lots sing sing laladedoo! Okay I'll come back and add to this later tonight. WOOOOOOOSH!!! Okay, ya know what I notice is that I have the same old problem a lot. I seem to be able to get along with many different kinds of people. The different kinds of people I can get along with tend to not get along with each other. I've found that this is a common problem for me. The people I'm friends with don't get along, they don't like each other, then they want me to choose between them..ouch..usually hard not always but sometimes yeah it is because I don't want to have to choose between them geez gosh people always so competitive. Yeah just thought I'd say that because it's something that I've noticed over the many years (ooo 14) that I've been alive. Holly Toledo I'm 14 thats old geez I remember in the days that I thought 14 was ancient. One time I remember arguing with my mom about candy bars I wanted a candy bar but she said no you can't have a candy bar but she got one. Then I complained because she got one and I didn't then she said when I get old and have a job then I can buy my own candy bars...huh I was little like 7 or 8 lol then yeah I really really wanted to be old so I could have candy bars..lol. Interesting isn't it? Yeah thanks. 3 more days and it will be my 10 day anniversary since I started the LTE! wooooooo! lol cool. :D Alright 1 of the kids is here now, yip! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! I get KUNG POW for my bida!!! yipeeeeee!!!!!!! uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh. I snatched you right out of the air! and when it arrives I'll smash it with a HAMMER!! Subway, Good so you don't always have to be. Today I heard that the meatballs at subway were made out of bread crumbs --yeah from somebody who works there HAH! Oh I ALSO learned that this guy who blows up cats lives by me, but I'm not exactly sure WHERE..kinda creepy eh? yeah I know...EEEEE! hehehehe I just went to the Flaming Chickens Website and found her philosophy thing it was very intriguing (sp?) you should check it out I liked it.HEHE By George I've gawt it! sorry just wanted to say that. I learned more today too, like they make thongs that play music when you sit down..cool eh? cept thongs are gross..hah I watched the Osbournes..well it was a long time ago but I remember and the Kelly girl lol hah this is great yeah her thong was so far up her crack that she couldn't get it out, and she shares thongs with her friend...thats pretty gross but ya know whatever floats your boat or finds your lost remote. ^^I don't wanna be a chicken, I don't wanna be a duck so I shaked my butt bum bum bum bum!^^ I like bum better then butt, but butt rhymes better (actually it doesn't but I was just trying to think of an excuse) MWAHAHAHHAHHAHHAAHAAHHHHAHAAHHAAH! Okay in respondence (lol um yeah) to Al's LTE I'm going to say that I used to watch a movie with a rabbit who ate worms and yeah I think it was The Big Rock Candy Mountains??? and I used to eat chocolate koala bears but now they're pretty much impossible to find and very costly -oh it's a sad life. "Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive." hum yep yep. I think Al's LTE might be beating mine now..MAN! lol I got to keep up! arr! it's difficult though because I don't have much to ramble about since my life is so boring and my brain is so small lol. OPE! guess what everyone I'm reading a BOOK. yep I am really REALLY lol cool eh? HAW yeah I know.. It's called Breathing Underwater by Alex Flinn and it's about some popular guy who has a good life pretty much except that his dad used to abuse him. He had this I guess really good girlfriend and he slapped her once and she took him to court and got a restraining order. I don't know I'm only on page 59 out of 263 so yeah but it's okay, it's pretty easy though not very challenging to your brain the words aren't hard or anything lol. Well at least I can understand it and I'll finish it in the 3 week period that I have, I hope. I only read it during school never read at home so yeah I might have to cram a bunch in at the last minute. I'm somewhat interested in the story it isn't terrible the abuse thing is interesting to me I like reading about that but still it's READING which I haven't done recreationally for quite a while but this isn't recreational since I have to write a book report on it. I have wanted a book though because I always seem to have free time in classes where I'm bored and so I can sit and read now but ever since I got new classes for the new semester I haven't had as much free time as I did to last semester. Stinks, I can't write note as often..cept in study hall I guess. Also I'd like to complain that they are making us take swimming a SECOND TIME (Evil) WHY do we have to take it twice?? Why don't they just put it all in one big clump and get it OVER WITH! I guess because of the girls having their periods so missing 2 weeks (approx.) instead of 1..but still ICK why do we even have to take it two times why not just once? I'd also like to say that yes most girls can wear tampons easily..I don't know how they do it..yes I'm sorta weird but I don't wanna stick anything up there it freaks me out ew what if it gets stuck or something and I can't get it out!!?!?! eeee lol yes I am immature but yeah skip it I don't care. I'm not the only person I know with this problem! I've heard that you're supposed to find the right 'angle' eheh eheh uh angle? oookaay and yuck when you pull it out does it all drip and sploosh all over the place?? and if it's made of cotton then can little pieces sorta fly off and then they just sit in there? and I mean if it's INSIDE of you then when you walk can you feel it rub against your insides??? I mean all these questions and I don't have the answers and sometimes idk if I WANT TO KNOW. OOOOHHH well. Feel free to email me with any answers you have. I feel really kiddish for asking this stuff like I'm old and I should know but yeah I don't lol I think I'm pretty immature for my age..HEHE XD good for me! Just got a phone call I guess the other cousin is coming over now too..yep yip yep yip. I didn't know if she was coming or not but now she is! not gonna make a difference though she just sits and does homework anyway. Then Danielle just plays with my brothers so it's pretty easy. I think that I've done a good job rambling today, I actually had a good topic that I can just type and type and type about lol without having to think about what I was gonna say about it, just flooooows out of ya sometimes. Okay I have this really annoying canker sore on my gum and a cut on my toungue owwie PAIN! Josh told me to add SALT to it lol (yeah I know what you're thinking OW) yeah it sorta hurts a little bit EHEM lol but it sorta worked...except mine is in the worst place because it hurts whenever I talk cuz it's right in the space where your lip attatches to your gum so ow my gum rubs accross it whenver I talk eck stinks. 1*27*03 HELLO ALL EVERYONE...welcome to my chambers MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAH what interesting things happened today? nothing that I can think of. My life is so boring. My stupid canker sore still hurts. My friends are weird. Josh told me to put salt on it, now Al told me to put ear wax on it LOL...eh taking a quick little break I's a be back! -------THIS MARKS THE SPOT THAT THE HERMNERP ALLIANCE WAS FORMED!!!YAY CELEBRATE MT.DEWS ALL AROUND!------- 1*27*04 *AL* WOOHOO Yipper Skipper me and Tiff got an LTE that is gonna be very very loooong!!! 1*28*04 *TIFF* WOOOP! WOOOP! here we go! dun dun dun, it is 7:02 aweeeesoooome. Well here's the deal okay so me and Al both started LTE's ya see and somehow mine got on to hers like where my ENTIRE LTE page was on her LTE page and totally erased all of her rambling and her lovely story about the old man...tragic isn't it??? WELL we decided to make an LTE together that would be TWICE as long as the other ones (AND it will be, you just wait!) I decided to give it a kick-off this morning with a little rambling of my own. SO I'm planning on erasing my LTE so I can spend my full undevided rambling to THIS one. doo doo! I got like 15 minutes left to just ramble ramble ramble! YaY! I probably won't spend 15 minutes HERE rambling though because I'm supposed to be getting ready to go to school. (oh yippity skippity school BLAH) Well I'll probably just have to type later so yeah gotta go get ready (put my socks on lol) for school! adios! I'll type when I get home. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! LUUUUUCY I'M HOOOOOOOME! BYE! I'll write later and Al gets home at 4:30 and I'm sure she'll be on. HEHEHEHHEHEEHEHEH!okay nvm HEHEHE I'm back hum hum me and Josh are gonna watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail cuz Al let me borrow it..thanks...lol yeeeah. 1*28*04 *AL* OOOOOOOOOOH YEEEEEEEEAH I'm all revved up and ready to get this brand new LTE going!!!!!! Ok, so I sort of came in during the middle but who cares????? WHO TOOK MY OTHER LTE???????? It was a good one cuz it had this great story about an old man....... that was two days ago... now it has dissappeared into some other celestial world....hmmmmm... I wanna watch Monty Python!!!! Nothing to do tonight.. so sad. I haven't seen that forever- only like once. But Ilike the torso dude! I will bite off your amrs and legs!!! this fight is not over!! We are the knights who say NEEEEE! Bring us a srubbery! So anyways.... yeah okay I'm bored... I get bored VERY easily... maybe I have ADHD who knows??? That would be sort of cool though ya know??? Oh yeah today I was on complete withdrawl from Mt. Dew because ya know I hadn't had it since Monday which is a really long time for me.. TWO DAYS!! Gah the torture! But anyways after school I had to stay for play practice and being me I was completely broke- so I told my friend Stacie to tell my mom that i was on complete withdrawl from Mt. Dew and ihad a HUGE headache and I was dying! So she did, and after much much much convintion from Stacie my mom brought me $1.25!!!! Isn't that great??? So I got my Mt. Dew after all! I was soooo happy! 20 great oz of delicious yummy great Mt. Dew. But now I found out that it only costs $1.10 at school instead of $1.25 so I got back 15 cents how wonderful!!! Oh I am hyper!!! Heh yesterday I got a T shirt for Asian club which is supposed to have BAMBOO on the back but instead somebody made it to look like WEED! Isn't that great geez and the School made them- what a great role model. lol. Hm I'm sorta cold. ya know it's cold all lonely down here in my basement because I am a deprived child who doesn't have a computer in her room . Waaaa oh well I'll get over it. Shooby Doo. WOOOOOOOOOOSH YEEEEEEEEEEAH! Guess what??? I CAN FLY!!!! I really really can! For real! Nobody believes but I can. Tiff should belive me cuz we're sorta childish like that heh heh he but she dosn't! All I want is one beliver!!! Jus one!!! Email us if you belive me!!!! Ok actually everyone email e and tell me yes or no and then after a while I'll tell you the results- like how many people belive me and how many don't. Hm I might update you every day maybe too. So anyways here's the story. when I was about 5 or E my grandma pulliam would babysit me and my brother after school on Fridays. This is the only time I could fly- when she babysat on a Friday. So I would stand at the top of my stairs- there were about 30 of them- and i would blink my eyes and be at the bottom. So it was like a flying/transporting type thing. But me and my brother still remember it to this day. Cuz he would watch me do it and be like WOAH! I did it twice. And that's the story!!! i think it's pretty believable..... how about ya'll????? i KNOW it happened too- It WASN'T a dream!!!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO how would me and my brother both have the same EXACT dream??? Just way too weird... But I've been having a lot of de ja vu lately.. de ja vu is soo much fuun- HAH sort of creepy but fun!!!!!

A lot of them are scantron tests too and I HATE scantrons lol. Most people like them because they are multiple choice and all but I do bad on multiple choice tests because I think skip that..multiple choice is EASY I can pass so I just yeah have that BAD ATTITUDE and fail lol karma ARGH!! my special little pirate sound ARGH! Someone should come to this website and leave a message on our tag-board...PLEEEEEEASE!!!!! no one ever comes they don't leave messages or anything we're all alone in the world.

The evils of the school system...ar...man no one (very few people) come here..argh...lol after ALL of that advertising too! geez WHY NOT! lol yeah I know reading about the lives of complete strangers isn't exactly the funnest thing to do but gosh I WOULD DO IT lol yeah shut up no rude comments there buddy. You think I don't know what you're thinking..but I DO lol and I don't appreciate it much..gar. Oh well. You know the snow is nice on Christmas but I think once Christmas is over it shouldn't snow again until like..December lol. Thats how the weather should be snow just 1 month and it has to rain at least 1 day out of every week..I love rain. I'm looking forward to summer in 4 more months..just to get school off! and I kinda miss the sunshine a little bit. I really like summer at nighttime with all the lightning bugs and it's really nice and peaceful..just thinking of it makes me happy. Like sitting on the porch with a couple friends and looking at the lightning bugs maybe catching a few and pulling there butts off (ALLISON lol) or just name them and let them go. You have to name them when you catch them don't just catch them. I also have a fettish of naming fire hydrants. My favorite fire hydrant is over by what used to be a big field with a bunch of trees where people always rode bikes but they sorta screwed it up, stupid people always do that. Wouldn't it be freakin awesome to live before there were any roads, sidewalks, cars and buildings?? I think it would be awesome! I'd like to go back to see what it was like lol...what is was like when everyone wore loin cloths. Too bad, it would be cool to still live like the indians did (in my opinion..but don't just listen to ME! send YOUR opinions!!!:D we'd love to hear from you!) 1*29*04 *AL* Ok yeah I was reading through the LTE and I noticed I spell a lot of crap wrong so just CONFIRMING that I'm not stupid and I do know how to spell (most of the time) and I DO know that BELIEVE is spelled BELIEVE and NOT BELIVE ok??? yeah just making sure so yeah hey start glazer your I wish Iwish Iwas a Fish is awesome cuz I kept saying it today and annoying people! Mwahahahaahhaahah man I got homework to do then off to show choir practice then back here to finish homework and take a shower and clean the house blaaaah I hate when my nights are pre planned out with crap I gotta do. I just wanna play on the computer all night... ARGH- ARGH is awesome cuz I say it all the time like in real life ya know??? Oh yea hthere has been no results to the survey because uh duh nobody's visited our website besides me and Tiff but I guess Tiff could have responded but she didn't- oh well she SAYS she believes me but I don't know if I can trust her... lol ya know what i want to accomplish in my life????? Not something great but I WANNA MEET MY TWIN!!! Not my REAL twin cuz I don't got one- but ya know how they always say that everyone has a twin somewhere in the world?? well, I wanna meet mine- that would be oh so much fun!!! watcha guys think? haha I don't know I believe in weird stuff. lol LADEDA ok I like chicken- chicken is good yum yum yum yum I wonder where everyone is???? because once again I am all by my lonesome... awwwww maaaaaan I feel so alone.. heeh no really. Hmmm man I'm not really in a rambling mood today!! Oh yeah I did get another Mt. Dew today after school cuz Kjirstin bought me one cuz I was going insane but it was only a can- 12 oz. It's actually cheaper to buy two cans of Mt. Dew than a bottle cuz for $1.00 you can get 24 oz in cans and with $1.00 you can get 20 oz with a bottle. See? more with the cans. Plus it tastes a lot better out of a can. Um ok I sort of have to eat something before I go to practice cuz ya know I'm kinda hungry???? So yeah gonna eat and stuff maybe work on my crap science homework who knows??? i hate science blah blah blah see ya round town........ Bad boys bad boys watcha gonna do? watcha gonna do when they come for you???

Hmmm I'm thinking about the St.Patricks Day party that I'm havin' this year..it's gonna be a big thing now I'm making a tradition of Tiff's St. Patricks Day parties! lol YEESSS! because of the whole Irish thing yeah.

One time I figured this out okay, days go by soooo slow (well, the ones when you're at school) but weeks fly by really fast and months yeah they go by kinda fast..before you even notice the month is over! lol thats what happened this month man I mean it's February now. I got stuff to do this weekend though to thats good lol don't gotta be bored! woop! Usually on weekends I do stuff now, not just sit at home like I used to..hah wow that was sad. I used to be pretty depressed and lonely and angry. I was looking through some of my old notebooks in like E grade and yeah ARRR!! anger, and 7th even too I was pretty angry and even in 8th grade I was more then I am now. Now I am happy lalalalala! lol I feel happy, I know GOOD FOR ME right..hehe YEP! ^^Here I go again on my own ner ner ner ner going down the only road I've ever known, like a drifter I was born to walk alone...and I've made up my mind..I ain't wastin no more time!^^ I always sing that song. HUM well I'm gonna go eat (7:10) need to leave in 10 minutos about so yeah need something to eat..even though that will just make me hungrier all day.

Stupid crunchy spicy chickens again yesterday hopefully they're not today. Well okay gonna go now then..adiadi. 1*30*04 *AL* HELLO! yeah I feel kinda BAD cuz I'm not a full fledge contributor like Tiff is cuz she writes much much more than I do.... I don't have that much TIME see? tomorrow i got a show choir competition and then I gt to babysit and then Sunday I gotta go to church and then get Gala stuff and then babysit some more... sorry duder heh but I'll be bback sometime soon... yeah. Nobody has responded to our surveys.. how sad.. not even Josh and I thought he read this??? What the heck? where is everyone when you need them? ok I'll be back in like 10 minitos but to you it will seem like nothing ya know.....ok I'm back- had to unload the dishwasher...yum I got a cinnamo pop tart while I was up there too- HAH retart tart tart like a POP TART! lalala I'm having so much fun..AHH I got a crumble inside the keyboard! hehe man I can't even think of anything to ramble about? what shall i ramble about who knows who knows... I WISH I WISH I WAS A FISH! and I really can fly ya know......well could. I'm gonna go check our email real quick- maybe somebody answered our survey!!! :D ok sad news.. NO MAIL-NONE WHATSOEVER!!! !GAHHHHH I'm really beginning to thinkthat this website reaches NO ONE!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I had this great idea where we could advertise it by makin glittle advertisments on the computer and then going to like Wal- MArt or somewhere and sticking them into the top-selling magazines and then when people bought the magazine they'd see the advertisement for our website and be like "Hey! That sounds like FUN! i've always wanted to read the Longest Text Ever!!!" Then we'd have lots of visitors and who knows maybe the guiness book of world records guy would buy a magazine with one in it and we'd be discovered except I think flaming Chicken's is way longer so she would probably win dontcha think? yeah... but still we'd have visitors!!!! Cuz I know that that works cuz i went to a website after seeing an ad in a magazine! In fact it was that www.beinggirl.com place I was talking about cuz it said "Are you more likely to get eaten by a skark when YA KNOW?" lol and I REALLY wanted to know the answer so I went there and guess what I found out??? The answer is YES!!!! scaaaaaaaary lol ladeda hmmmmmmm that was interesting. Today we signed up for classes for 10th grade. How exciting huh? yeah except Tiff got to be in the class I really wanted to be in- Computer Graphics- GAR I have to wait until like 11th or 12th grade when I have room to take it. argh luuuuucky! That's what I want to do- computer graphics. WOOHOO fun designing movies and signs and ads and stuff. That would be cool and I would buy all the movies that I designed and I would know HOW I did it bwahahaahahahaahh lol my fingers are cold from sitting in my oh so cold basement. YUM we got some Mt. Dew to drink tonight yum yum yum yum yum but of course we would buy it! heeheh but of course is fun. but of course! but of course! Iwanna get my permit. Me and Tiff and another friend were supposed to get them in the summer but ya know we sort of procrastinated about it forever and like E months later we STILL don't have tem. But ya know I think we're gonna get them in the spring. WE THINK. Have faith in us geez. heh actually I dunno if we'll REALLY do it either. Maybe Tiff will and then she could just bring me even if I really didn't study and then I could just mesmorize all the answers for the secind time. thats' what I heard everyone else does. yuuuuuuuuupperoo WOWZERS! ZOINKS! JINKYS! hehehehehe funness! :D XD :D XD :D XD :D XD follow the yellow brick road.. I wonder where Tiff is anyways.. she said she was getting on- maybe she IS on and we're doing stuff to the website at the SAME EXACT time again woooooooah creeepy lol I like stuff like that- like stuff that happens in Final Destination or weird coincidences and mysteries no one can explain that send a CHILL down your spine! AWESOME! Or telepathic people! Sometimes I'M telepathic! yup I got that power too! One time Ipredicted that Tiff was gonna say EGGROLLS! yeah there was other stuff too.. just cant remember. lol I forget stuff really easily. REALLY easily. lol hmmmmmmm ok welp I didn't really type much but uh yeeeeeeah ok wait I got a cool idea from Star Glazer to do a WORD OF THE DAY!!!! So here's the word of the day- umkay? dude (dood, dyood) n. U.S. 1. A man who dresses in a flashy or extremely fastidious manner: dandy: fop. 2.

WOAH weird I didn't know that. well that's not how I or anybody else I know use it... weird. that was fun let's do another one! Strait jacket A tight jacket of strong canvas, for confing the arms of violent patients. yea that was a no-brainer heylook! what-so-ev-er (hwot'so-ev'er) adj. & pron. Whatever: more formal usage. Also poetic NUH UH! It doesn't mean whatever! this dictionary is stupid! I have a spanish dictionary! it's fun to look up stuff! MWahahahahahahah hehe anyways guess I'll type more later!!! See ya later alligator! After a while crocodile! See ya roooooooound toooooooooown that's fun to say! Dd you know that i laugh at everything??? Ireally do cuz in SS today Icouldn't stop laughing cuz one of the "jobs" of our little law debating team was to mark down each time someone made a positive contribution to the team and I thought that was sooooo sstupid that I cracked up about it the whole entire time and people thought I was insane. anyways I'll be going now. lol 1*31*04 *TIFF* LAST DAY OF JANUARY! AH man I have to write later me and Josh are NOT ARGUING we're DISCUSSING lol about the universe being infinite and all that great stuff so yeah bbl..alrighty guys I'm back! Now now now YAY it's the weekend, what I've been waiting oh so long for. ^^You are the one that I've been waiting oh so long for^^Okay don't know the other lyrics to it sorry. I kinda have to go pee but I'll hold it for a little bit. I'm going to have to type a lot today ya see cuz we have like 59K and I want to type enough that I get to 70 because I DO NOT want to have to stop in the E's lol. EEEEVVVVIIILLL. Okay now I'm going to go pee. Alright I feel better, had to run all the way downstairs because my brother is stinking up the upstairs one..ee oh crap he just left nasty yuck that took WAAAY too long. This is going to be pretty difficult..gotta type A LOT. Sorry to flaming-chickens about the infinite stuff because she had that on her lte but I really found it very interesting..I like it lol. So lately I've been talking about it with people like seeing what they think and stuff, it's interesting. FUN! Crapper doo! I don't have much rambling done yet today...need to be working on it. Well okay then hum this is HARD lol because my life..so dull so very very dull. Tomorrow I'm going to church with Al then we're going to the mall to look for stuff for Gala..except the little problem that I don't have any money lol. So we're really going to just LOOK..probably at least, really don't think that I'll BUY anything hah oh well..nothing I really need anyway-I hate dressing up ewwwwie ew ew I hate it. I'm mad they're having gala in the cafeteria at our school..thats retarded because we have to pay 12 bucks to get in to the cafeteria?? wth...lol ar. Still gonna buy the ticketes..I'm paying for Josh MWAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA it's funny..hehe. He left his little money clip thingy with the dog on it here (yeah ya did..just so ya know) there it is sitting there, isn't that nice lol. Money Clip..thats weird..why not just put it in your wallet? I mean the dog is pretty cool but still...I guess if you don't have a wallet it would come in handy, keeps your money all organized and stuff. Well hmm idk where this came from but yeah I think I'm probably gonna be moving sometime over the summer like August probably and at my new house I get to have the basement to myself except my dads computer room. I guess my bedroom is gonna be downstairs but we have to BUILD it so for the first couple weeks I'll have to sleep with no walls..which I hate a lot lot lot because it's hard to sleep in a big room where people could..come..lol. My dad plays his computer a lot too which will suck because he plays it really loud...rar. Well though still cool because were gonna have like a guest thing downstairs where people who come from out of town can go and it will have a tv and couch and bed I think idk I think so (bed), I think it will be cool because when no one is in town lol which is most of the time..like all of the time..then I can get the whole thing to myself like a little apartment..HAH AWESOME! I hope it works out though cuz that would be cool..but yeah my dad always says we're gonna move then backs out then again and backs out again again again over and over he always does it but this time he's pretty sure because my mom is going to graduate in a few months so we'll have enough money and they really like the house. My mom is in college by the way to become an RN (nurse) right now she's one of the lower nurse thingies lol but yeah so yeah. I HOPE IT WORKS YAAAY awesome my own little living quarters wooop wooop. I'm excited!! hehehehe lol watch it won't work out now hah, best not get too happy cuz then yeah it won't work..just my luck. I SHOULD have really good luck because I'm IRISH :D :D :D hehehehe -which yeah I can't complain because I do get good luck a lot of the time. Oh yeah I'm a lot Irish and a lot German...thats pretty much what it is theres other things but like just little teeny bits of it like 32nds lol which yeah doesn't really count that much because thats barely anything. Oh my gosh gosh gosh I felt like I talked forever and it was only 3K's lol. Thats said I was thinking at least 5! cheezer louiser. I need something to eat I'm really hungry. I'm listening to Def Leppard..I like it..cool. Thinking about being Irish and then St.Patricks Day and my party lol ...gotta have it...EVERYONE'S COUNTING ON ME!! AHHH SOO MUCH PRESSURE! lol. Okay I really am really hungry..I haven't eaten like anything all day it's 5:59 (no seriously..it is not just doing it because of E..EEEK) but yeah what should I eat? I think I'm gonna have ramen noodles..HEY! they're good! and only $1.37 at Wal*Mart!!! doo doo! cool cept Wal Mart is too far for me to walk. Over by Al's house, which if I move I'll be able to walk to Wal*Mart, right now I really don't wanna because of the brr cold of the winter..brr tomorrow is February! month of looooove lol I guess since it has Valentines Day in it. Valentines are always so sad, you just watch all the happy couples being..happy...bleh then ya think whoa..I'm a loser..(LOSER PRIDE!! LOL). I need a new hairbrush..have you ever had a hairbrush where little gray lint things grow on the bristles?? well yeah mine is like that probably because I don't pull the hairs out enough and just let them sit til they coil around the bristle thingies well not bristles but they're pokey things ..w/e you wanna call them. Then it is all gray and linty and people come over and see it and they say "ewww gross! what happened to your hairbrush?!?" hehe then I laugh MWAHAHHAHAAHHAHAHAHHAHA nasty isn't it?? HEH HEH... Okay my stomach's growling so I'm gonna go start boiling my water...doo dee doo. Okay I got up to 5K..hah the here I go again on my own song is playing again.. I like that song. oo Yeah that reminds me I sent a survey out (don't worry Huong I didn't send it to you lol) COOL! maybe I'll get a fun little email to read. I also sent Josh an email about his LTE so maybe he'll maybe answer me...(PLEEEASE I'M DESPERATE!!!) hmm and okay yeah thats all but still. I'M AWAITING YOUR REPLIES!!!! lol okay now for serious I'm going to go boil some water. I got some bread..hehe. I eat a lot of bread. Just plain. It's good like that. Oh yeah I want to report on the status of my canker sore..lol it's STILL VISIBLE but doesn't hurt very much, it is going away YAY! it only hurts when I like pour salt on it lol. My cans are starting to collect all on my desk. My shelf is full and now becoming unrecognizable. OH how sad, I have but only 1 pack of yummy beef flavored ramen noodles left...boohoo. The reason I eat ramen noodles actually is so I can use chopsticks. I love chopsticks..they're FUN! It makes eating your food into a game..I like it..I really enjoy it, a lot, so when I go to my friends houses and they have oriental food and they give me a fork cuz they don't think I can use chopsticks..it's a real let down. Cuz I look forward to getting to use the chopsticks..I really do..it's AWESOME you all should try it if you haven't..woooohoooo okay beeep beeeep beeeeeeeeeep..I'm coming I'm coming sheesh. Ramen noodles fill ya up for about an hour but then after that you're hungry again. hah always happens to me except usually I don't get full I'm just always hungry. Always eating..yum yum yum. Okay I'm gonna eat them now I'll come back and ramble on later, when I'm done..hehe. Okay I'm done..dee dee. WTH is with the sound effects anyway? huh..I'm weird sorry lol. ^^Monday he woke up and hated life, drank until Wednesday and left his wife. Thursday through Saturday lost everything, woke up on Sunday miserable again.^^ My toe is bleeding..cool lol. Yeah I used to think it would be awesome to be a surgeon but naw I decided no because thats too many years of college! AYE! Don't want to go that long, and I'm not smart enough lol. Holly toledo my room is a disaster argh..I'll have spring cleaning this year I guess..yeah..thats it..lol SURE I WILL. Just like I'm going to get my permit in spring..heh..NO REALLY I'm going to, you don't believe me, do you? errr well I'll prove you wrong! ^^Educated, with money, he's well dressed, not funny. And not much to say in most conversations, but he'll foot the bill in all situations cuz he pays for everythiiiing. Girls don't like boys, girls like cars and money. Boys will laugh at girls when they're not funny. Paper or plastic, don't matter, she'll have it. Vacations, and shopping sprees these are a few of her favorite things. She'll get what she wants if she's willing to please, his type of girl always comes with a fee, hey now theres nothing for free.^^ I wonder..is there anything for free? I don't know..in a roundabout sense nothing is for free right? lol wth I alsways go on these weird things lol I'm weird okay man I'll stop. ^^The girls with the bodies like boys with ferraris.^^ haah thats funny. Ya know what that bugs me, people who are really materialistic..I think it's stupid. Clothes and stuff is stupid lol. You don't NEED THAT STUFF! and being popular would SUCK...seriously dude..it would. I've listened to those girls talking about guys and all their friends behind their backs. Wth yeah everyone probably does that but they ALWAYS have something bad to say...and why does it matter what other people are wearing? come on be a little mature lol. HAH thats funny I say that because it's those kind of people who call me and my friends immature-which we act immature a lot yeah but actually I think we really aren't as immature as some of those people, we may act like that but it's for FUUUUN.. lol Yeah sorry just thought I'd go on a little shpeel about that maturity and materialisticism and stuff ya know lol. ^^Can you feel the cold tonight? It sets in, but it's alright. Darkness falls..I'm letting go. All alone but I feel fine.^^ MAN MAN MAN I hope that we have a snow day tomorrow..PLEEEASE PLEEEASE PLEEEEASE PLEEEEASE! lol I HATE school and going one extra day in summer won't kill me. Actually I'd really like year long school because instead of going a HUGE chunk of the year then getting a little chunk off, you get it evened out-so you can go 3 weeks get 1 week 2 weeks off idk how it goes something like that though..I'd like it. If theres still year round school then I'd like to start earlier in the year like once August comes go to school lol. By the time August rolls around every year I always want to go back to school because I'm always soooo very very bored of summer..nothing left to do, I've done it all! So I want to go to school again (sad isn't it) yeah it is. Then in May I'm dying to GET OUT of school! ^^It's been a long hard road without you by my side, why weren't you there on the nights that we cried? You broke my mother's heart, you broke your children for life..it's not okay, but we're alright. I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes..but those are just a long lost memory of mine. Now I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive, yeah I'm still alive.^^ HAHA I keep singing Good Charlotte..thats who I'm listening to..GO FIGURE.. but yeah I liked some of there songs actually -no new stuff though that I know of. I don't know how I'd know though ..don't really watch tv..or listen to the radio..ever lol. Hum thinking about when I get old and have kids..lol. I want like 2 kids but I really kinda want a boy. I don't know why, I just do. Either would be okay but I kinda want a boy..lol I'm weird..people always talk about how boys being little terrors lol. A girl would be nice but yeah I never really like the girly stuff-I was always weird, people used to make fun of me..boohoo..lol. For wearing boy clothes and not playing with dolls. My cousins made fun of me a lot lol. Oh well SKIP YOU GUYS! lol. ^^Some friends become enemies, some friends become your family. Make the best with what you're given, this ain't dying, this is living. We're moving on, and we ain't got nothing to prove..to anyone..we'll get through.^^ Alright I'll stop really lol. Duuuuuuuuuuuuder I wanna put 1 more K so I can have 72! 72 is my lucky lucky number! lucky..reminds me of Shamrock McShelby!! elevator fixer! hah from D.I. hehe. I was in D.I. in 7th grade so was Al and she was a clown and I was an elevator fixer awesome eh? yeah lol except the fact that everyone hated it..I sort of enjoyed it. A bunch of our other friends were in it too yep! Huong and I having a spot of tea in the elevator lol. That's my favorite memory from it all. We ended up doing the whole thing wrong though-can't blame it on ME because I never even got to read the DIRECTIONS! rar! geez. ^^I'm happy, feeling glad, I've got sunshine..in a bag. I'm useless, but not for long. The future is coming on it's coming on it's coming on.^^ Me and Al are going to have a fish tank wall in our college apartment. We went to this spanish club party thing to these peoples house and they had a fishtank built into a wall and we thought it was cool so we're gonna make an entire wall out of a fishtank COOL HUH! except easily broken..uhoh oh well lol yeah with us there it probably will break (especially Al)..HEHEHEH JK cho well ..sorta..lol. Those people were rich they had a lake with a swan, a golf course, planes and a home for their mobile home..lol. YaY! I'm at 72K! I feel in a singy mood today. doo doo..grease hah. ^^You better shape up! cuz I neeed a man and my heart is set on you. You better shape up, you better understand to my heart I must be true. You're the one that I want woo oo oo honey. The one that I want ooo oo oo the one I need oh yes indeeed. If you're filled with affection, your to shy to convey..meditate in my direction, feeeel your way.^^ I don't even know if those lyrics are close to right lol..hah OH WELL barely anyone comes here anyway lol and after all that typing I doubt anyone made it down this far lol. I sorta like grease..hah..weird huh? Now hug your bobble head dog and tell him you love him! Does that ball..bounce?? OOO LET ME SEE LET ME SEE!! BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE!! Tigger..hehehe, do I bounce when I walk? maybe I'm just feeling very joyous sometimes so I bounce..maybe thats all. bouncy bouncy bouncy ^^Another turning point a fork stuck in the road, time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go. So make the best of this test and don't ask why. It's not a question but a lesson learned in time. It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right...I hope you had the time of your life.^^ Well if you did make it this far.. I'm going to leave (finally..I know) buuuubye! ^^For what it's worth, it was worth all the while.^^ 2*2*02 *TIFF* TODAY IS A HAPPY HAPPY DAY! SNOOOOOW DAAAY! School is CANCELLED!!

Since I wasn't here yesterday I want to say HAPPY GROUNDHOG'S DAY yesterday but bleh he saw his shadow so that means E more weeks of winter. argh argh argh I hate winter... it sucks. I got a calendar that says like every holiday almost so I'm trying to say Happy something whenever there's a holiday!!! I wanna make everyone feel included ya know. lol o.O bwahahhaahh GUESS WHAT????? i was so very very very very very happy today because my neighbor got this HUGE mt. Dew beach ball at a super bowl party and she gave it to ME!! It's awesome- all big and balck and green and saying Mt. Dew one it. It made me happy. Oh with all the future stuff- it makes me seem like a sad person or something lol. Cuz I never really WANT to settle down or anything- I think it would be awesome just to always have fun and travel the world or something- but hey I'm only 14 I might change my mind. If I have a kid- I'm tinking I might adopt (cuz ya know AHHH scary) I'm gonna name him/her Tipo!!!! That's an awesome name for a guy or a girl!!! lol it means DUDE in spanish. OOOOOO DI haha i was a stupid clown hahahah i wrote the script and people added to it- i don't think Ishould go into script writing or anything- it was a pretty weird play- all about a lawyer who goes into an elevator and there's a clown in there and the elevator gets stuck so the lwyer has to learn to put up with him like all night and in the morning the lawyer's gone completely insane and changed in to a clown himself. But we had to do this thing where they give us some random object and we have to incorporate it into the play 20 different times and we didn't do too great on that and w eforgot to do background changes and we didn't do our wood sculpture right at all- the wood was like 100 times too big lol so yeah it was all messed up. We actually DID buy the right wood atfirst but then people thought it was wrong and blah blahb lah but one time we were tasting the blasa wood (the right wood) to see how soft it was or what it tasted like. we were like eating it. a lot. it was sort of good. I didn't remeber that until Huong emailed us and told us about it. lol but yeah we sort of dropped out of the state compettion. i really want some KFC and Mt. Dew........oh yea hthe other day (the SNOW DAY) i went to Wal- Mart and bought some awesome Valentines! Ias gonna get the Scooby Doo ons but they were pretty retarded- like more for lovey stuff than friends so I got these other ones like deformed cats and dog ones lol they're just like made weird on a computer so they look funny ya know? but they're cool. I LIKE THEM!!!! Aww yeah and then I read my email and Tiff set these awesome astrology things- like compatability friend things- they were fun to read! even if ya don't belive in it it's just fun to read it and think about being magic and stuff!! that would be totally awesome to hve magic powers!!!! And I think there are aliens out there somewhere. MWHAHAHAHHAHAHAH i just thought of something.. it's funny- you'll probably find out about it sooner or later cuz it's just totally great!!! tiff will tell ya proabbly next week- I just can't tell ya now cuz ya know I can't. Man show choir try outs are tomorrow-I gotta practice my song still. i'm only gonna be in it if I make it into the higher show choir though- connection. Cuz it's worth summer school i guess... we're getting cool t shirts for my current show choir (Harmonics) they're like black with gold lettering and they have some sort of picture or something on them and they say our nicknames on the sleeve. I'm just putting Al on there- couldn't think of anything else. hah I just noticed you guys don't even know my real name!!! Awesome i'm just Al to ya'll- I mean it's sort of easy to figure out Tiff's real name but mine could be anything!!! this is cool so mysterious!!!! i wonder how much I wrote? Aww only 4K. it felt like more than that. suckolla. we had these stupid ITED's today- like ITBS and I didn't know what any of the vocabulary meant- I mean how are we supposed to know some weird words??? geez and plus they like go onto our permanent records and help choose classes for us cuz of that stupid No Child Left Behind Act- grrrr Bush makes me mad. I'm a DEMOCRAT!!! And very proud of it!!! I want John Kerry to win!! That would be cool- but any of the Democrats winning over Bush would be good. *cross your fingers* lol I sound like Tiff. Mt. Dew...... I got this awesome Zobmondo book and it has great stories in it. I'm gonna get it. Ok a man from Maine heads down to florida for a weekend trip; his wife is coming to meet him the next day. he gets to his room, sets up his laptop computer, nd sens her a short email to let her know he has arrived. Unfortunately, he makes a typo in the address and his note is sent to the elderly wife of a minister who just died. When the grieving widow checks her email later that day, she lets out a scream and falls to the floor. Her children come rushing in to find the following on her screen. Dearest Wife, I have just arrived. Everything is prepared for your arrival tomorrow. Can't wait to see you. your loving Husband. P.S. It sure is hot down here! LOL funny ok here's another one- On the first day of school the first grade teacher announced to her class that they should put the baby talk of kindergarten behind them and start using grown-up words. She then asked them to tell her what they did over the summer. The first little one said he went to see his nana. The teacher said, "No, no, you went to see your grandmother. That's the grown-up word." The next little one said she went for a trip on the choo-choo. The teacher again said "No, no you took a trip on the train. That's the grwon up word." Then the teacher asked the third little one what he did during the summer. He proudly said that he'd read a book. The teacher asked what book he had read. He puffed out his chest and in a very adult way replied " Winnie the Sh#t." HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAH i love that one. i got more but geez they take a long time to copy. Ok here's a blonde joke. A breasttroke race was being held from Santa Monica to Cataline for femal swimmers, and a brunette, a redhead, and a blonde were the competitors. After about 14 hours, the brunette staggered up onto shore and was declared the fastest breastroker. About 40 minutes later, the redhead crawled in for second place. Nearly 4 hours after tha, the blonde finally came ashore and promptly collapsed in front of the worried onlookers. When the reporters asked why it took so long for her to complete the race, she replied, "I don't want to sound like a sore loser but I think that those other girls were using their arms." heheheheeh ok I better go I'll be back tomorrow. i promise. 2*4*04 *Tiff* HEY! WELP..I just made a quiz and sent it out to everyone gonna see what everybody gets on it. I have a feeling that people might not do as well on this one even though the questions are pretty simple. Hmm I got 100% on Tina's heheheheh WOOHOO! okay I don't really feel like writing on here maybe I will later lol I know I know that was so extremely short just I'm in the middle of a conversation and I don't FEEL LIKE IT! lol good for you readers out there (all 2 of you well maybe 3..MAYBE) OKAY! Still have homework to do. Okay today was funny because for Texas Roadhouse (where we're going for homecoming) yeah everybody keeps asking to come with us...An wanted to come but today found out nvm she doesn't. Stacie wants to go with her date now and yeah Al's making sure it's okay with everyone, doesn't matter to me. Welp yeah lol it will be funny HEHE. I'm 'discussing' with Josh about Heaven and Hell. Any Christian believers out there who would email me and please tell me how is it fair or just that people who do good things and are good people all around just aren't saved go to hell and people who can do tons of bad things but just ask to be saved are saved and get to go to heaven so easily? I don't think it's fair because I mean some people are just introduced to it when they are little so they learn it their whole life then are saved, even if they are bad people who do mean things and sin they only have to ask for forgiveness and get away with it? I don't know that much about this subject just trying to learn so anyone who knows tell me please. Don't get offended by anything I say, I just don't understand it all. People who aren't brought up that way, and are brought up to believe something else are just sent to hell because they never ask to be saved? They were taught to believe something by their parents, and they trust their parents (there's even a thing about supposed to honor thy mother and father right?) okay so they do and they trust them so they are sent to hell? Alright just wanted to babble about that I know a lot of people don't even believe in it sorry lol but yeah it's MY LTE (and Al's of course) so I can type whatever I want to! I don't like that people who are nice and do good things end up in hell when complete jerks end up in heaven. Not saying that everyone in hell is good and everyone in heaven is bad no no no no no NOOOO don't believe that at all, so don't get me wrong. Not saying Christians are jerks woo I really am not just making a point (trying). SOMEONE help me I don't get it at all I'm uneducated lol. 2*4*04 *AL* I know I promised I'd write today so I couldn't break my promise but I don't got time to write much cuz I gotta study for a science test I forgot about. AHHH science scary!!!!!! science is evil. adios duders! 2*5*04 *Tiff*!!! HEEEEYAA!!! How is everyone TODAY? thats great! (I think) ^^Your love is like a roller coaster baby baby, I wanna ride. Your love is like a roller coaster baby baby, I wanna ride. Move over there cuz I'm a double dipper. Upside Down on the dip dip dipper. One, Two, One Two Three, oh I've got a ticket so ride with ME. Merry go down on the Merry go round, all is fair on a big fair-ground. Lets go slow, lets go fast, lickery split gonna whip your WOO WOO WOO WOO!^^ Hah I like that song it's awesome. Okay gonna go to the mall quick (I think) for stuff for gala ...yep last minute ooofff coouuurrssee. hehehhe. SOO anyway I read Josh's LTE the ending part it's pretty confusing but I liked the part about people always having to destroy everything..we do. It reminds me of the saying 'rules were made to be broken'. Which is party true I guess. Rules were made to be obided by but the consequences were made for when you break the rule...eh w/e idk what I'm talking about g2g p then leave but yeah I'll probably come back later and type actually I'm pretty positive that I will so I guess I'll be..yeah back later. Gonna leave my away message up the entire time hehehe...it's a cool song too. ^^Who said that I wasn't right? I've lived for years without a life. Don't have a soul on my side. Still ridiculed despite how hard that I have tried. Don't take me under your wing. I don't need a hand, don't need anything. I've got a roof over my head, as if I'd rather be alone with me instead.^^ Doo Doo Doo woooooosh! AWESOME! It's 7:11 COOOOL, Al's favorite time lol. ^^Hit the road Jack, and don'tcha come back no more, no more, no more, no more, hit the road Jack and don'tcha come back no more!^^ BUFFALO!

OH-oh-oh wait wait, you're Mufasa's little STOOGE. I madam am the Kings ____ dodo! and that would make you. Future King! and do you know what we do to Kings who step out of there Kingdom??? .....WHO YOU CALLIN UPIDSTE?!! I feel bad..I brought Douglas home and I'm not even going to write in him. Drives me crazy when people do that they just keep it..don't write in it. DO THEY KNOW HOW EXCITED I GET TO HAVE THE NOTEBOOK???!?!?!? why!? very excited yes indeedy doo. lol. hum I'm going to look for a new icon I've had the same one forever, geez. Today in 4th per. English I was singing home on the range, I always do that, always tell Bailey to draw buffalo because she always shows her drawings..she's good. She won't draw buffalo though..geez not one measly little BUFFALO? come on..DRAW A BUFFALO!!!! she knows she wants to just in denial. DENIAL DENIAL DENIAL! like Josh, says he can't bowl but really he can he just wanted to trick us..evvvvviiiill!!! lol CoOL I saw one (buddy icon) sugar rush neeeato cheetos! think I'll take it! cooooolio. ARGH! not working not working Commooon oh well (all well) hehe I might be back later chos adiadi buuuuuubye! 2*6*04 *AL* Coolio tomorrow is Gala and we're going GLOBOWLING!!!! Awesome I can't wait- I love to bowl- but yeah Josh he lies ooo big time cuz he said he averages 50 in bowling and he was getting over 100 cuz he doesnt hold the little hole thingers he just throws it but we both know he's lying he just didnt want to seem like this awesome bowler or anything so if you ever happen to see him just say DENIAL DENIAL DENIAL heh i love to say that. anyways babysitting tonight. lalala I don't really have anythign to say- this LTE is dwindling away.... ummmm oh yeah I found out for sure now that it WAS Phi who hacked my last LTE and ruined it. EVIL PHI!!!! I gotta get more quizzes for my website. *TIFF* HAHAHAHHAAHHAHAAHAH! no no no the LTE MUST NOT DWINDLE AHHHH!!!! just that it's a slow time because all that we are talking about is gala. Gala, gala, gala, gala blah blah gala gala lol, umm yeah cuz that is the only interesting thing going on in my life and yeah so thats all I talk about lalala. Well hm yeah so yeah lol she SAID EVERYTHING! thats all thats going on in my head but yeah ya know I'll write lots after gala talking about how it goes and stuff. I need something DRAMATIC to happen so that Ngoc can get her story lol. She wants to know if something dramatic has every happend in my life and well nothing I really want to have her write a paper on lol..it's a little bit personal ya know? but yeah oh well this would be a good paper. It is a phase biography so has to be on someone else. I'm writing a phase autobiography --and yeah since my life is so extremely boring I have nothing to write about, but Melissa came up with this idea to write about WAFFLES. Ok WHAT IS WAFFLES YOU ASK? no, NOT the breakfast food. Waffles is the Williams Association For a Free Lunch Environment...socks. lalala. lol. OKAY what it was was a revolution against the system last year in 8th grade at Williams Intermediate. It was made up by me and Kehlie to change the system! Ya see in 8th grade 1st semester at lunch we could sit WHEREVER we want, with our friends and everything BUT 2nd semester they CHANGED IT!!!! *gasps!* They made us sit with our CLASSES ..eww...lol. Well we made up ideas to get back at them and TRY to make them change it back. We wrote this threatening letter and glued ham to it...under the ham I wrote "jiggle jiggle change lunch back or this will be YOU..FOOLS!" well not that exactly except the jiggle jiggle part. Kehlie and I got quite a chuckle thinking of our associate principal at the time lol JIGGLE JIGGLE, she did the pop after lunch when they did The Casper Slide and it was quite disturbing lol. ANYWAY~ another idea of mine was to stick pizza and french fries down the toliets til they were clogged - mostly just cuz I thought it would be fun but ALSO to DISTRACT the opposition. Mwahahahhaahhahahahhaha! okay soooo. Well it never worked but I'm remain a PROUD WAFFLE! (I wrote that at the end of my paper..because..I AM a proud waffle!) hehe, yeah that was fun...wonder if I have to read it to the entire class. hehe. Nobody is online to talk to. argh. and no one ever leaves tag-board messages on MY site..it's sad..really sad...I'm soo looooneely!! HAHA Huong ^^When I was young, I never needed anyone. Making love was just for fun...those days are gone. Living alone, I think of all the friends I've known, but when I dial the telephone...nobody's home. All by myself, don't wanna be all by myself..anymore. Hard to be sure, sometimes I feel so insecure and love so distant and obscure, remains the cure. All by myself, don't wanna be all by myself..anymore.^^ I kinda like it okay so just yeah I know you guys all think I'm stupid (yes all of the millions of readers out there!) lol but I don't care. BOOYAW! lol. ^^All things considered I'm doing just fine, even though ya left a hole the size of Texas deep inside, and my heart the way I'm feeling should be losing my mind but all things considered..dun dun, I'm doing just fine!^^ I still have a butterfingers on my desk from Christmas. I offered Josh the butterfingers but NOOOO he doesn't want it. He should want it. His e-mail says butterfingers in it so WHY WHY WHY doesn't he want the butterfingers? WHY? I don't get it. It still has the wrapper and everything..mint condition..not like I peed on it or anything. It's not contaminated or poisoned..it's a little old but I mean what is the butterfingers expiration date? a long time isn't it? yeah probably let me check. Okay it doesn't tell me but it's probably still a long time away ya know? right? HAH me and Al's sacred special mt.dew expired on June 7th. June 7th we gotta get together and savor it hopefully it will still be good it says til June 7th so it BETTER BE! Ya gotta have the willpower man! Yeah then after we drink it we got to go get another one HEHE to be the *ALL NEW* sacred Mt.Dew. 2*7*04 Tiff here, 11:34 ahh thats creepy!!! wths lol okay nvm anyway..wow thats weird wth. YEAH well it's the day of gala. Gala sounds stupid why can't they call it Sadie-Hawkins anyway? thats what it is...oh well. Just finished my 1st mt.dew of the day. Josh wants to come over early so he should be here in like 2 or 3 hours I guess. Thinks he's gonna do my hair AHHHHHHH thats really scary but I don't think I'll let him. lol. Welp I got time to kill now. This always happens before some exciting event. The day of the thingy you just sit around and do nothing before it starts -there isn't anything to do! I can't get dressed yet I'll end up getting the dress icky before I go out and eat (where I'll double the messiness) and I don't want to wear panythose and heels for 12 hours so no. ^^Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own. Tell me that it's better when you're all alone. Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch. Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much. Tell me you ain't dying when you're crying for me. Tell me who's to blame for thinkin' twice, Cause i don't wanna burn in Paradise Oh, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go...^^ Aerosmith awesome. Yeah I'm always bored before I go somewhere and I'm bored now-don't you hate it? all full of anticipation and not being able to do anything just makes it worsez! rar! My fingernail polish looks really creepy..lol COOOL heheh. Well I'll tell ya how it goes....doodoo! 2*8*04 *AL* well heeeelllllooo there everyone yup we're back from Gala- it was fun! Especially the Glow Bowling part!!!!!!! i love to bowl AND Tiff looked all tan under the black light so that was really cool too- but uh ok here's how it went--- we went to Texas Roadhouse Grill to eat and we all ordered (ALL is me, Tiff, Josh and Rusty) chicken critters and mashed potatoes and baked beans except Rusty had a salad. Yeah so anyways we're talking we're talking and ya know Rusty has to go to the bathroom so while he's there we tell the waitress that it's his birthday ( ya know it's really not until August 14 but what the heck) so the whole rest of the time we just laughed at our clever selves but I don't think the waitress believed Josh cuz nobody ever came out with the horse to sing to him. So then we left to go to the actual DANCE. So we get there and we get in and then we get pictures and then we dance but a lot of the songs were like slow boring ones-so sorta blah ya know but then they had some fast fun ones like at a dance club which sound like fun and we were swing dancing and square dancing type dancing yup- cuz me and Tiff requested COTTON EYED JOE!!!! That song rocks!! ^^(cool) if it hadn't been for Cotton Eyed Joe I'd been married a long time ago! Where'd ya come from, where'd ya go, where'd ya come from Cotton Eyed Joe???^^ AWESOME!!! So yeah we danced our socks off and rocked our socks until it was time to announce the Gala King and Tony Johnson was SUPPOSED to win cuz he puts the "T" in "cool" but there was some kind of mistake and some other guy won. SO I DEMAND A RECOUNT!!! lol so then we left the dance sort of early cuz it wasn't all that great and we went and changed out of our dresses(HALLELUJAH!) and went GLOW BOWLING!!!!!! We got awesome shoes with glow in the dark shoelaces but me and Tiff had to trade one cuz one pair didn't have glow in the dark shoes and she needed some too right?? But I kept getting gutter balls- I think I came in third the first two games and wee were really craving some Mt. Dew too but there wasn't ANY so that was sad but we ended up getting some later. Then we had a tournament between the guys and the girls and me and Tiff won totally!!!!! :D :D :D :D yeah so that was the night and everyone was really hyper that night too- like we couldnt stop laughing and Josh couldnt stop screaming. lol But ALL IN ALL it was pretty darn fun. i think we're gonna go Glow bowling on a regular basis. This weekend there's a party gonna be going on at Tiff's house. IT'S GONNA BE SOOOOOO MUCH FUUUUUN!!! I can't wait! :D XD! yeah I'm gonna be all excited all week. But I can't say aything about it right now. You'll find out later. heheeheehehheeh But for all you people who aren't in high school- I would RECCOMEND not going to Gala and Prom and stuff unless you're like going with a guy- cuz they play a lot of slow songs and stuff which aren't very fun- especially Gala cuz it's a like a Valentine's Day Dance and all. But Homecoming is REALLY fun. Lots of good songs and stuff. But that's just my school. Maybe yours is different. Idk. I'm very immature. MWAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAAHAHHAH heheheheeh anyways i gotta go look up lyrics for Cotton Eyed Joe. ^^What's the D-D-D-Dilio Dilio What's the D-D-D-Dil? what's the D-D-D-Dilio, Dilio? What's the D-D-D-Dil?^^ That song is cool but that's the only part I know. heh *TIFF* THE DILLIO SONG IS AWEEEEESOOOOMMMEEE!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah so yeah gala was fun actually gala was kinda stupid EXCEPT for like a couple of songs (COTTON EYE JOE!) otherwise yeah DUUULLL lol. Glow Bowling was the BEESSSTT! AHH MY GOSH lol it was awesome chos, I WAS TAN!!!

Yeah me and Al and Josh were just cracking up at dinner when Rusty got back from the bathroom cuz Josh told the lady it was his bida. It was retarTed (retart tart tart like a poptart!) because she didn't even do anything..ar! Dude glow bowling's music was WAY better then the crap they played at the dance! eww that wasn't worth the money I paid lol ... like REALLY we shoulda just gone glow bowling because that was awesome!!! lol yeah if you can't tell I really really enjoyed it. WOOP! I love to bowl lol it's fun! haaah lol but I don't know if I'd really like to be on a team because I don't like to compete much, rather just like ya know mess around its way funner.

I'm gonna put it on a CD over and over and over!!!!!!!2*10*04 HEY! okay I got like 7 minutes to type and I'm going to try to get a little bit added. It's been hard to add to the LTE for Al because she's busy a lot always gone and me? no excuse..just don't know what to type. SOOOO instead of typing on here I just sit at home and whine about how incredibly dull and boring my life is when really it doesn't HAVE to be that way? Life is what you make it right? right so if I could just find something to beleive in and something to do then I would always have something to think about and always have something to do and yeah I wouldn't have to sit at home and mope. wah wah wah my life is so boring. wah wah wah. When really there are people who are never bored, there's always something interesting to do. I'm thinking about doing soccer this year at West but I'm not sure if I will or not. I kinda just want a hobby, something to do, SOMETHING and I feel pretty out of shape and unhealthy and I think doing soccer would help me out. Only cons is that it takes up a lot of my sit at home and do nothing time which is so very important to me :D lol. I feel happier now then I did before. herm...NERP! hah. Nothing really to add though, nothing interesting happens. I CAN'T WAIT TIL SUMMER! Ah oh my gosh I've been like saying that all the time lately but it's true! last summer was sooooo mucho fun-o lol and I want to have another mucho fun-o summer! No school! yesssss! This summer I THINK I get to move too! cool! YAY! lol I'm excited! if you can't already tell which yeah I think you can. hah. I already talked all about me getting to move. It's sorta weird writing here because I don't know who is reading it I'm just writing to the air. Hey! whoever wants to read about Tiff or Al's life you can find out here. Hmm. Makes you feel weird like very exposed (even though very few few few people even come here) hah. I wonder how much I've typed so far. I think it's actually almost been 7, oh it's been 5. Well ya know I am going to type 8 because my other clock lets me have 2 extra minutes. hehe. Well I was gonna type until 10:00 then just go to bed (nothing else to do). 2*14*04 *AL* Happity Valentines Day everyone or Feliz el dia de San valentin! Yeah I forgot how to do the accents (I lost the code sheet) Anyways just thought I should type something here cuz I haven't in a while but there's really nothing interesting going on.... we had the party for Josh last night and we gave him the special present!! It was funio! and then when we came in from playing outside in the snow, I got charlie horses in both of my legs at the same time and it hurt REALLY bad like I was gonna die. GAAAAAH soo very hurtful!!!! And we got spun upside down- sooo much fun YEAH summer that was fun lots of fun stuff but ya know we did have a great summer jumping off cliffs and stuff!!! :D I also got chased by this dude yesterday, cuz Iwas gonna walk and meet up with Josh and Tiff and this guy was coming one way and I was going the other way and I passed him and he turned around and was like HEY! so i walked over to the other side of the street and went the other way and he was gonna start chasing me but this lady saw him that was delivering stuff to people's dorrs so he got scared and ran off but ooo it was scary. lol but yeah that's my exciting life right now. lol i think I'm going to a Mallards game tomorrow hmmm don't know for sure. President's Day off!!! Awesome- I think friends and me migt be going over to Huong's. Not sure yet though. yup yup talk at cha'll later. adios 2*15*04 hey guys! ahh man I know it's been forever since I've typed on here aye aye aye I know. blah. Well I've been busy lately ya see on Thursday me and Al went to buy stuff for Josh's party which was on Friday and we also got to pick up little teeny pieces of styrofoam and put them in garbage bags! Oh and I had coffee that made me really hyper and yeah WAHHOOOOO!! when I got home it was good TONS of sugar and yeah cream and yeah it was actually good just tasted like straight sugar though. Welpers I just got home from church it's AHHH 12:34 how evil 34 but how cool because 1 2 3 4 hah awesome even though yeah 34 is evil. Josh started that 34 thing ya see it's evil because 11:34 is hell and now he always see's 34 whenever he looks at the clock even though that is only "he" but yeah still creepy because it's ALWAYS something 34. eeeeek! Yeah and I made this cool CD for Allison has cotton eye joe on it! even though it has the second verse twice but it's still cool. Has It's Tricky, pussycat song (lol), all things considered, uhh chickity china the chinese chicken, have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin! and a bunch of old songs..kung fu fighting, drift away even though it's not really that old lol, Mr.Vain, Wanna be my Lover yeah etc... can't remember. I'm eating those red hot thingies they're good mmmm but yeah not hot lol. They're in this cup that Josh gave me yesterday that we made at the firworks place. It's cool it's red and has a storm on it, black clouds and lightning and weird trees lol because I can't paint a tree and a funky lookin' cave lol. It looks like an igloo..sorta. Yeah last night I went with Josh to blackhawk state park and we went on this trail in the woods it was cool yeah but we saw this rat and he got scared so I had to carry him all the way back. It was one of Mr.Weber's rats that he collects. Didn't I tell you? Mr.Weber is a rat collecter he has those little tube thingies running all through his house..the entire house is wired. They're all attatched to the ceiling. So ya see now when HE is in the bathroom he can watch his rats go to the bathroom TOO. When he is sittin' back watching the ice skating tournaments, his rats can sit back and watch "the power of cheese" commercials. Turns out that rats aren't into ice skating. So they leave during that and come back for the commercials. Okay yeah back to my ORIGINAL story. So I was carrying Josh back to the car and we got in and yeah zoom zoom zoom and we're back at his house, then we watch this movie and I fell asleep on his couch and when I woke up he was staring at me with a freaky look I was scared lol. Right now as I write this I'm wearing his sweatpants because my jeans got all wet, they're really comfy, I think thats what made me fall asleep because the sweatpants are so darn comfy. I don't think I'm gonna give them back, I'm just gonna steal them and keep them forever MWAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAH! my sweatpants!!! MWAHAHAHAAH! naw thats not nice, I'll give them back but I got to go out and buy myself a nice pair of gray sweatpants. Oh and yeah back to Friday at the party and I skipped some stuff I got to do Saturday too, I was busy busy busy hehe NERP!. Well ya see on Friday me and Al had this party for Josh just to give him his bobble heads Ike(his alien wife), Jimmy (his alien child) and the fireman which uh idk if it has a name. WELL! yeah the party was cool we played outside and it was fun hacky sack, and we spun around in circles upside down weeee! and we made snow angels and my toe hurts and Allison got charlies horses (uh I think) in both her legs and collapsed onto my floor lol it was funny. Ok then on Saturday (I found your hacky sack Al it was behind the couch) anyway yeah everyone came over and we just sat there for a long time because no one talked at all but then we started getting into it talking discussing and yep. Well I'm not gonna really get into it. Huong wants to be a cocoa bean. lol. Alright I got to go look for Allison's book thinger but ya see I think she's wrong because I was pretty sure that she brought the book home but yeah maybe I'm wrong so I'm gonna go look. Man man no one ever leaves anything on the tag-board and Allison has had forgetful as her mood FOREVER! lol CHOSTER is gonna be on our liscense plate cool huh? yeah heheheHEH! My room is a huge mess eeeeek! idk if I'll be able to find Allison's book that is at her HOUSE! lol watch me be wrong heh great. Oh yeah at the party thing Friday we played with the balloons we put them in our shirts then sumo wrestled to see who's would pop first it was funny. For some reason Josh got really lucky and his didn't pop as easy as me and Al's. It's not fair just cuz he's taller so we can't get the full affect on his balloon ya know. That's when I hurt my toe it bent like funky yeah all they way I was standing on top of my toe that was smooshed under my foot yeah it just hurt okay still hurts. I keep getting hurt lately. I hate the word cream. Dictionary.com does exist! and vacuum cleaners are evil I have 2 scars both caused by evil vacuum cleaners, vacuuming is the worst chore in the world...well idk about cleaning the toliet or vacuuming okay hard choice herm I'll have to think about that one...2*18*04 *Tiff* ey! I know I know eeeeek I never type on here anymore aye! told you though my life is so dull and nothing happens and just gosh actually I don't think my life is that dull..to be honest with ya, I think it's pretty interesting and I like it but yea other people would praobably say that my life is boring but yeah thats them soo BLAH I don't care! lol Al said she was gonna type on here and she uh never got on lol. Must have been busy or yeah something. I think I'm gonna get a Mt.Dew. Waaaaaaaah! this is sad while I was gone everyone drank all of the mt.dew this is really sad gosh people come on be a little considerate. Got water instead. My tastebuds are all owwie from eating red hots tons and tons of red hots and hot tamales I've been living on them lately oOoOoOo so good. The water is really cold kinda hurts me teeth owwie lol I don't like my teeth can't bite into ice cream either ow hurts brain freeze eeek! sad so sad. So I had this creepy dream last night with yeah Josh he got in a car accident and so he had to go to jail,lol hey things don't always make sense in dreams. Yeah so he was in jail and he got beat up by this huge guy it was weird it was like this really tall huge fat guy who punched him and he went down with only one punch and then the fat guy jumped on him and punched some more. But he lived! lol. Okay then erm yeah I was at 5 points and I was looking for Josh in the prison (taking my time though hahahahahahaha!) yeah and I went on the little stairs but couldn't go over them they kept going up and up and up and wouldn't stop! ahh neverending stairs. The sky was red too like bright red and everything kinda reflected off of it so it looked all bloody everywhere. Yeah then I woke up. I woke up a few times during the dream too mostly during the beat up part so when I went back to sleep it just repeated Josh getting beat up only like yeah 3 times though lol. HAH! lol yeah but I was pretty freaked out it was a scary dream. Red sky and neverending stairs and having to save Josh from jail. It's supposed to rain!!! YAY! like at the end of this week I guess like yeah Thursday (my favorite day :D) lol or Friday yeah. hehehehe! I'm excited it hasn't rained in a long time and I love the rain, so much I love the rain. It's cool it's like you can go out and walk in the rain and you feel relieved? everyone is going to think I'm a big retard for saying this lol but ok it is therapeutic, it lets the sadness out. Watching rain helps relieve sorrow lol. The rain is like teardrops that let all of the sadness out so then when the rain stops you feel better? I like during best though. I like to be sad sometimes actually, I listen to sad songs and just be sad for fun because yeah I find it fun. It is fun. Actually not fun there's a different word fun isn't it. Rain is wonderful! If you have no sorrows you can just go out and run around in the rain and play in it it's fun. You don't even have to be IN the rain you can just sit on your fron porch thingy (this is what I do) and watch it from under the roof thingy lol. Or I go in the garage and get a little chair and just sit on it and watch the rain and write. It's cool I enjoy it a lot. 2*19*04 *Tiff* hey again guys >me Tiff, putting off hwk so yeah hello. I have nooooooodles! yum I love noodles. Noodles and milk because yeah no mt.dew yesterday evil Roberta takes them and doesn't finish them. I can't stand him grr I want outta here.

Miss EVERY problem? dang sad lol and it's going to be ME. I changed my whole thingy to green like the computer layout color for St.Patricks day I'm not really a huge green person it's okay but not like my favorite color or anything its alright. I think it might get annoying and I'll end up changing it after a month of torture lol. It's not torture just different and really bright and yeah. Lots of hwk tonight. ARGH!

Helicopter is the most addictive game I've ever played and even after I played it a kazillion times ina row I only went about E00 feet. blah lol And never ever ever ever buy wrapping paper from the dollar store!!!

It's 26 letters long! 2*22*04 *AL* Hello everyone once agin- wow nobody's wrote here for about 3 days- maybe 2 idk lol but yeah I was at a show choir thing all weekend- on Friday from 7:45 in the morning to 7:30 at night and on Saturday from 6:00 in the morning to 12:00 at night- it was the longest two days I've ever had. lol but- being the good friends that they are- Tiff and Josh came to keep me company on Saturday at 2:00 so we went over to the Blackhawk Hotel to go up to the 11th floor to see what it looked like and then we went to like the 10th, 9th and maybe 8th floor too not sure, but then we rode back down to the 1st floor- oh yeah we went to the Eth floor too to see if they skipped room number EEE but there wasn't that many rooms- but anyways when we got out at the 1st floor there was a guy standing there and a lady from the hotel said she's had kids running around all day on the elevators screaming down the halls and dumping over ash trays and putting chairs on the elevators and stuff and we said it wasn't us cuz ya know it wasn't but they didn't believe us and had the PD come in and call our parents and Tiff and Josh had to go home after they'd only been there for like 30 minutes. But even Mr. Weber saw us get on the elevator too and he didn't say anything and he got on the elevator too and was riding it so we thought it would have been funny if HE was the one who was running around screaming and dumping out the ash trays and stuff and riding from floor to floor lol and then it was his evil plan for us to get caught and not him. lol yup and then today me Tiff and Josh were gonna go bowling cuz it's like our favorite thing to do so we went to our trusty Leisure Lanes but they had league bolwing all day so we couldn't bowl so we started walking not knowing where we were heading and then along came one of Josh's friends and he gave us a ride to the mall so then i got some orange chicken and Tiff got a Super Burrito (she's had one every day this weekend) cool huh? lol thenI got some Mt. Dew and then we went to Toys r us and walked around and bought some balloons which we WERE gonna play balloon sumo wressling with but then we couldn't cuz Josh ended up having to go home after we walked from Toys R Us to Bowlmor Lanes where we actually got to bowl 4 games except I don't think that we are gonna go back there cuz it pretty much sucks- all the lanes are messed up and it's really small and it's pretty much cursed cuz these two boys had shirts with the numbers E and 34 which is Tiff and Josh's evil numbers- I don't have an evil number- maybe I should get one lol. So yeah then I went back to Tiff's for like half an hour and we talked and then I came home and ate and now i'm sitting here typing lol and tomorrow is Monday so we get to go back to school- YAY not. man I cannot wait until summer- it's so much fun- but hah probably won't type on the LTE much. in summer we go exploring all the time and walk around everywhere- the creek is really fun to explore- fun times, fun memories. ahhh man I just want it to be summer even more now. The winter sucks and so does the spring mostly. In spring all it does it rain rain and get muddy and blah but Tiff likes the rain but hates Spring- lol doesn't really make sense. we have like E5 days left of school still- ahhhh too many!!!!! save us all please!!!! hm I might have already said that lol. I have a tendency to reapeat stuff- like a lot. At the show choir thing yesterday Ilearned this really annoying rhyming ting- it goes Hey (name)! Hey what? Are you ready? For what? To jig! Jig what? Jigallo! i put my hands up high and my feet down low! This is how I jigallo! S/he puts his/her hands up high and his/her feet down low. This is how s/he jigallos! jigallo! Jig Jigallo! jigallo! Jig jigallo! heheheh anyways it's pretty annoying...did you know in Me, Myself, and Irene there's a cow that doesn't die? I saw that movie a really long time ago nd I forgot about the non- dying cow. that's the funniest part though. lol shooby doopy doop welp I gotta study for tests that I missed for show choir- blah too many tess- the torture the torture!!!! lol see ya around hm actually probably not lol. 2*23*04 heya heya hello weekend didn't go well and neither did today BLAH! oh well what can I do? yep exactly. My computer is still screwed up so I'm on my dads..hah. Figures he got on mine because HIS was messed up, now his is fixed and mine is broken THANKS A LOT. So negative..sheesh. Well yeah the thing Saturday with the police was retarded. We didn't do anything and right when we got to the bottom floor there are a buncha people yelling at us, came out of no where. hah I was thinkin' what the heck are they talking about. Yeah so we had to sit there while they called our parents. Al's were there so they just took her away to them and me and Josh had to sit there FOREVER ahh! lol yeah the lady got pissed because we were laughing- we were NOT supposed to be enjoying ourselves!!! bad children naughty naughty. Yeah then Jody came and was mad and we had to write sorry cards lol. Then yeah we left BOOYAH! you stuuupid people! garrrrgaarrr!! This is really short. I have nothing to do...boooored bleh. herm I should prob change my imood I guess yeah probably. I tried to get on here Saturday but couldn't..password troubles. Man I wanna listen to music but idk where my dads music is...and I'm scared of what he will have in his music file. eeeee. OH WELL can't find it anyway just going to have to sit here bored and musicless oh what fun. Doing laundry...fun. Got to babysit tonight bleh just another crappy thing to add to my crappy day..crappy last 3 days. Well okay yeah they actually were okay woulda been pretty fun but each day seems like there was something to ruin it. Curse of the E and the 34. hahahaha Josh hasn't typed on his LTE forever. Man I want a pretty candle..I think I'll steal it mwahahahahahahhhahahahah! being evil on the LTE makes me feel better about my crappy day sorta lol. Whoa wths creepy my dad has lots of lightning photos ..I wonder if he looked through my stuff and stole those from me lol. Some of them look familiar and some don't so yeah I don't think so. Thats a weird coincidence though cuz I have lots of lightning pics on my computer because one day me and Josh were on google looking at lightning on the images thing and I saved a bunch of the cool ones. Creepy why does my dad have those..creepy. I don't HATE Spring I just don't like it that much..I love rain though thats the only good thing about spring is that it rains, and that it's closer to summer which is closer to fall. I love fall. It feels like I've been typing and typing but haven't gotten anywhere because I don't think I have 2K even maybe I do. Idk but yeah feels like forever and I have basically nothing to show for it. hehe I'm looking at the pictures on the computer...hee it's fun..:D okay gonna go do that for now adios until I get bored and come back! mwahahah! hehe 3*1*04 *Tiff* Happy March. I wrote on here yesterday but it didn't send. I'm been having lots of computer problems lately so I couldn't login to angelfire and type on here - always got messed up unless I was on my dad's computer. I want to move out of this house I hate it. Hum. What to put? Allison said that the LTE was dwindling lol HUM I WONDER WHY. lol -errr I went to internetjunk and put that I think gays are wrong lol and yeah they're going to be mad I can't wait to see what they say. Josh made me do it..he sorta persuaded me to put it. Like everyone on that site disagrees with me haaaaaaa. Funny. Don't ya think? I do herm..NERP! Isn't life funny...idk what is getting me on this subject but yeah you know a lot of people think they know people but really don't lol like okay most my friends don't know me very well at all they just *THINK* that they do-it's actually really sad when I think about it. Really sad. You don't know how little people know until there is one person who knows A LOT-thats just me actually who knows about everyone else. I don't know my friends very well either so it all evens out. If everyone was gay then humans would be extinct..eventually..wouldn't they? I have the urge to take some quizzes and put them on my website but I don't know if I'll get around to it. School is alright lately actually-even though I hate it. lol. I like social studies..I actually learn in Mr.Pagan's class. I really dislike math..have a C in there. Hate Acapella and DEFINITELY don't want to be in it next year. Don't like English Strategies because they lady doesn't teach the way I like teachers to...teach lol. She isn't clear enough she just like gives us a paper then we guess when it's due lol. She also gave me a C when I turned everything in and said the reason is because we haven't done much in class? wths? Yeah whatever thats retarded so I'm mad lol. I am not against C's or anything I just think it's stupid that I'm getting a C for no reason because I do a lot of annoying crap in that class. It's too unorganized..I don't like classes like that. Then Spanish sucks I don't know why I hate it I like spanish the actual language just the class sucks it seems like it drags on and on and we do too much work we have to think too much lol. I liked last semester better because yeah she just let us have a free period pretty much except for writing Vocab and taking tests lol. Then Science is alright I guess...nothing really extra special there its just another class..yeah..uhuh lol it's alright. So yeah just went through my schedule and whined about my stupid school life blah! I really want school to be over, I'm ready for summer vacation. I wrote on the internetjunk site about abortion too-it's weird, I used to be very very much for abortions but now I am completely against them..weeird. Now I don't even understand how someone can be for them really? I sorta do but I think that it doesn't make near as much sense as being against them. I don't know what I think..weird. My reasons aren't really religious even but they were saying on the site that they were moral reasons. I didn't think so. Just that killing is wrong but yeah okay lol is that really a moral reason? Are there people who think that there is nothing wrong with killing innocent babies? I am for the death penalty so it's not like I think killing is completely wrong -but I think it's justifiable in some situations..like Saddam lol. Well I'm not really sure haven't really talked to anyone about it before where they disagreed and I could see their views. I have a little I guess but not too much. Alright I might get on later. I love thin mint girl scout cookies <3 <3 <3 like really a lot so very much so so very much. I ate almost an entire package of them yeah like yeah just now ew just sneezed out of my mouth lol...ha! E-mail us! and tell us if you stare at your poop as it flushes down the toliet! I sure do watch poop spin in circles as it flushes down the toliet! Say it loud and say it proud! :D lol why are people embarassed? Everyone poops! Do you think that no one else in the world has ever pooped? Well they have! Everyone poops! POOP! POOP! POOP! Hallelujah! lol okay thats a good place to stop..see ya later alligators! woop! hehehheheheheh I feel hyper now..DA! hahahahaha. well basically.......HA! Okay I'm done. 3*2*04 *Tiff* heya chachis!

How do you spell premiere+ing? cuz that looks messed up.... yum I'm gonna go to Wally World tonight and get some gum cuz I haven't had any since forever... I just had a craving for it today cuz it seemed like everyone had gum and I'm stuck having none!!!!! yum I love Girl Scout cookies too!!!! :D :D :D :D :D :D thin mints and peanut butter things and caramel delights and pinantas- those are the ones we have. Idk what the pinatas taste like cuz I haven't tasted them yet.... they got starberries on them. blah blah blah school- couldn't wait for it last summer cuz I got bored towards the end but now I can't wait for summer!!!! molecular biology is okay but Brooker is always saying "Onward class" and thinking up labs that don't work- like today we were supposed to get DNA from a banana and then say "Look it's DNA!" and then do nothing. lol idk kind of funny.. but Strunk was way cooler. Acapella and Show choir ahhh don't get me started Weber is scary and I'm quitting both next year. phew. Band- ya know just normal- okay. ummmm Geometry- boring- who needs to know how to write proofs??? are we gonna prove everything in life? why can't people just accept that it's true??? geez and Flinker... Spanish is ok- the most exicting class of the day almost besides Brooker's and his labs. American Studies- AHHHHH I HATE history! So boring.... ok well that was exciting- I'm sure you all wanted to know that... heh gays getting married- hm well it's their life and if they want to screw it up and sin big time then that's their choice and besides they're really not hurting anybody anyways. yup me too totally against abortion- Pam Stenzel "My father is a rapist. I don't even know my nationality. Do you really think that my life is worth less than yours because of how I was concieved? I didn't deserve the death penelty for some crime my father committed." yeah I totally disagree with it- the baby doesn't deserve to die- and I believe since I'm a Christian that everybody has a purpose in life- so what if the baby that was aborted was meant to be somebody special- or make a huge difference in the world? Or save somebody from an accident or dying? Now they won't be there to do all those things and more people will suffer from it than if the baby was there and lived their life. That's just what I think though. This is sad- I can't even think of my own topics to write about- just responding to Tiff's. Nobody's ever emailed us responding to anything on here. That's really sad. I wonder if anybody even reads this besides our friends. Probably not. Argh we need to reach the world!!!!! lol it's almost St. Patrick's Day!!!! Tiff's having a party except now my show choir show-off thing is that same night so I don't know f I'm not gonna be able to go or she's gonna have it on a different night or what. i'm gonna go check the mail. I love mail!!!! lol maybe I'll get my YM magazine that's LATE by the way. Blah it's not here yet. Uually it's here by 4:00. GRR maybe we got a substitute mail dude. Substitutes are always late. yup. It's raining. MAybe I won't get to go to Wally World. Man that sucks. I bet Tiff is playing in the rain. Or not. I went to see The Passion of the Christ. it's good but really brutal. That whole movie is basically beating Jesus. It's really sad- not an uplifting movie at all really besides the end where he comes back to life. I don't like depressing movies. Just comedy and stupid humor. Like Scary Movie 3!!! I love that movie!!! Scary Movie's ok and Scary Movie 2 sucks. But Scary Movie 3 rocks my socks!!!! I'm buying it when it comes out on DVD. I heard that Simple Plan's making another CD too- GOTTA BUY THAT!!!! :D :D :D :D I'm excited! Herm I'll see if my brother wants to go to Wally World with me- it's too boring to go alone. Going alone is just... lonesome. lol So I'll talk at ya'lls later. 3*5*04 *Tiff* heeeeeyy! hows everybody?! thats great! lol I'm waiting for Al to pick me up to go to the lock in tonight at 10 until 7 tomorrow mornin'. lol hoping that it's funnerER then conversion-conversion was depressing, no mt.dew ..like a teensy cup lol. Nothin to do either..argh, well what can ya do? I don't really got nothing to say ew 8:34 it's seriously haunting me this is creepy geez. I already feel tired lol not good gar probably just because I'm home and not doing anything at all I just need to go somewhere and DO something yep thats what I gotta do yep yep I can cure this. I had to pee a lot today like a lot lot very lot idk why just did hm yeah why did I mention that? because I feel the need to pee again lol. Room smells a lot like febreeze very springtime fresh lol I love febreeze especially since my house always smells like dogs ya know? yeah maybe you don't yeah if you had a dog THEN YOU WOULD KNOW except just seems like my house smells so much worse then everyone else's (um probably because it does..lol). I wonder when Allison will show up herm herm herm nerp! idk whoa cool moodring is really blue. ^^I broke a thousand hearts, before I met you. I'll break a thousand more baby before I am through.^^ haha listening to B-B-B-Bad to the Bone. Okay really gotta go pee now lol. Weird, pee was clear..weird lol-happens when you drink lots of water but yeah I don't think I had that much water hmm.weeird. I lost my sheet with the way to make the cool little lines over the letters-the accents for different accents I think Josh stole it he needs to give it back..lol. I have too much free time. Oh my gosh how did I ever sit at my house all day? I used to ALWAYS be home when I was little-ALWAYS ..man I NEVER went anywhere lol except school..thats sad, I don't know how I did it man I mean I've been here for like 4 hours and I'm dying of boredom..can't take it..AHHHH! Somebody save me! Time goes so slow. haha just heard a weird saying last night "A watched pot never boils" I guess it's common but yeah I've never heard it lol. I like saying it's fun to just go around and say a bunch to people and see if they get annoyed or if maybe they'll think you're smart lol. I'm gonna try to memorize a bunch by time I get old so everything I say can just be some weird mind game-ya know like all those really wise old guys in movies..wouldn't that be awesome? I think that it would be. 2 weeks to spring break YAY! gonna go booooooowling! woooop! 3*8*04 *AL* BOWLING!!! Awesome!!!! Today is the day that I got my permit!!! Woop woop!!! I missed 5. Then my mom let me drive the van around the block and I almost ran into a parked car. That would of been bad so good thing I didn't ya know? lol We're gonna go to the creek over Spring Break too!!! The creek is fun- you get all dirty and stuff then we all look homeless lol. I'm bored today so I can't think of anything to write. Sorry- LTE really is dwindling- good thing Tiff writes on here too or else it might be gone!!! AHHHHH 3*9*04 *Tiff* Dang Al like 4 lines here I go to write my 4 lines too. I got my permit today too yep (1st try hahahahahahaha) lol yeah but I missed 7 so I BARELY passed the thing..eeek. I'm an organ donor! :D lol so when I'm there dying on the street they're not even gonna attempt to save me just ya know kill me steal my organs and stuff to give away. Ha, yeah but yeah oh well I'm dying anyway might as well. Hmm yeah hard to think of stuff idk what to put sorta hungry but not really just ya know lol want to eat since I'm at home and er thats what I do when I'm at my house isn't it? yeeeah...my dad finished all the chimichangas they're GOOOD they look sorta narsty but taste good..like a burrito sorta. Yum...too bad Tiff they're gone. I like Huong's idea with the song thing it's cool to have a song every week that you like because yeah I like lots of songs and I always just sing them on this..to make it longer lol..and in the ntbk too w/ everyone because yeah I just like songs. Well maybe I'll write later since I typed so very very little (yeah sad I know..oh well) alrighty! YEEEEPPPERS! I came back! here is my song for today that I like lol I like lots of songs but yeah man everyone is gonna make fun of my song lol. ^^I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons, finally content with the past I regret. I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness. For once I'm at peace with myself. I've been burdened with blanks, trapped in the past for too long. I'm moving on. I've lived in this place and I know all the faces, each one is different but they're always the same. They mean me no harm but it's time that I face it, they'll never allow me to change. But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong..I'm moving on. I'm moving on at last I can see, life has been patiently waiting for me, and I know, there's no guarantees but I'm not alone. There comes a time in everyones life when all you can see are the years passing by. And I have made up my mind that those days are gone. I sold what I could, and packed what I couldn't. Stopped to fill up on my way out of town. I've loved like I should, but live like I shouldn't. I had to lose everything to find out. Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road. I'm moving on. I'm moving on....I'm moving on.^^ That's the entire song..it's good I like it, so shoot me lol. 9:44..herm Wednesday tomorrow..lol hump day! middle of the week we're coming towards the end. Yay! then next week is the last one and then spring break yippee! but IF me and Allison (Tina maybe too) do soccer we might have practice EVERY DAY oh wow every day lol. Haha I remember last spring break when I was in "track" lol thats when I quit because I didn't want to run 10 miles over break! ah no! hehe but soccer is better then track much better still mucho running but yeah it's way better..more then JUST running. Haha I wonder if Allison will even be able to play..lol..that would be bad if she bought all that stuff then quit haaah. 3*10*04 heya duders! I took some more quizzes alrighty so yeah check my thinger website okey dokey? yep! Hm nothing interesting going on well sorta. Gotta get my 50 bucks by whatever um Sunday lol for the trip to Colorado! hehe...and dude man I need to get new soccer shoes for soccer (dur for soccer whats my problem). Mine are a size 4!! my goooosh lol I wore those in 8th grade! holy cow! geez..can ya believe it? they are big for 4's though dude that is pretty small..ha. Grasshopper cookies oOoOo dude this is hard my life is so incredibly boring. Hey did EVERYONE know that the goverment built a big underground city thing so if we got into nuclear war they could all go live underground?? like so the goverment would still be running - I thought it was selfish yeah but I guess it makes sense since yeah you'd want the government working so it wasn't complete chaos even though it sorta is huh. 3*11*04 SCHRINKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm dying of boredom...SOMEBODY SAAAVE MEE!!! can't take it!! waaaaaaaaaah! yeah okay sorry about that guys. I really want to put a page for lyrics on my website but I can't figure it out! It doesn't let me have any spaces so I can't get it to work! garrrrarrrarrr why not? I'm listening to poison..something to believe in. It's a sad song. Listening to morningstar by A.F.I earlier it's sad too..I made it into an away message. When my dad messed up my computer I lost all of my away messages..and I had a lot. Most of them were songs that I liked and I took all that time to type them now they're gone. ^^Well I see him on the TV. Preachin' 'bout the promised land. He tells me to believe in Jesus, and steals the money from my hand. Some say he was a good man, but Lord I think he sinned...^^ continue on and on. I don't really type that much on here. Whenever I get on I only put a little bit and then yeah nothing. I wonder who reads this. No one sends us emails telling us what they think about the stuff we bring up. BLAH getting a headache from being bored..eh..all I did today was walk up to McDonald's and get a chicken sandwich..on the dollar menu $1.07. Mayo all warm from the chicken. Took me 27 minutes to walk up there and go in and order and get my food and walk back home. Was it all worth it?? lol. Sure why not I was bored anyway. My mom came home and got Randy starburst, and Robby some weird candybar..and herself a 3 musketeers but yeah didn't bring me anything. I was watching her give them their candybars and didn't say anything. They all hate me lol. They favor the little boys. Blah..gay. lol. I was mad..lol. Man I'm hungry! Yeah see we have no food at all in our house so if anyone wants to eat they have to leave and go somewhere and get it. Boys are still whining about my parents not going grocery shopping when they got candy bars. Ungrateful little vermon..lol. I was on intyjunk a lot today. Didn't really post anything just reading a bunch. I should read my book, but I don't feel like it. Spring break in only a week! awesome! Oh yeah the variety show was really good. Me and Al and Josh all voted for the cowbell one number 4 it was awesome. Except! if anyone asks Al voted for number 1 okay lol. Oh well no one is going to read this anyway right nobody evil enough to be that evil...right? Okay. I wonder if people DO read this..hmm...I wonder lol. Why would they? probably not intersting just all about other people's lives..I read all of Josh's LTE and everything that Al writes on here of course but yeah I find it interesting lol. I wonder if anyone else is like me...lol easily amused (HA!) actually idk if I'm that easily amused..I always thought that I was. Maybe I am sometimes with certain things but other things I think are retarded. I wonder if my grade in English went up from a C. I shouldn't have gotten a C. I did all of my work and all of it was on time and none of it was THAT crappy lol it wasn't THAT good but not THAT crappy. A couple of my papers were pretty good -for me- well so I thought I guess. She told me it's just because we haven't done much in that class so everyones grade is low. If we haven't done that much then wouldn't the grades be higher? hmmmm. We have JA in that class now but the guy is pretty good. He is a hairdresser lol...he gave everyone his business card..heh. He says he's a very social person and loved school when he was a kid...weirdo lol I hate school it's so boring. I updated my site a lot today too. I put everything into little groups like the quiz group and the choster website group and the website website group. I've been on aim ALL DAY...ar but NOBODY is on! everyone always asks why I'm not on and now that I am on they aren't on..well not everyone just SOME people. I gotta go pee, guess this is a good ending spot lol. 3*15*04 *AL* HAPPY BIRTHDAY NUONG!!!!!!!! ok hey hey hey everyone I know I haven't typed forever Lo siento Lo siento okay herm we're singing these stupid songs in acapella by these King's Singers people and it's E guys and they all look gay and one of them wears girl sandels and sings really really high. And all they do is take other people's songs and arrange them differently so they sound stupid. yup yup But there is this one cool one called Blackbird- blackbird singing in the dead of night... spread your broken wings and learn to fly.. all y life.. blackbird singing in the dead of night.. open your sunken eyes and learn to see... all my life... yeah nerp herm nerp herm oh guess what?! I went driving yesterday- my first time. I went over to K Mart and drove around the parking lot and around some neighborhoods and then I drove fromK mArt to my house which isn't very far but it was good for my first time. And I practiced parking and reversing and turning and blah blah blah.....it's hard to stay under the speed limit though WOOHOO this is the last week before spring break AWESOME!!!! We're going bowling and creeking, and 5 Pointing and walking and all kinds of fun stuff IF it doesn't snow all week cuz it snowed today which is retarded cuz Spring is in E days- so it shouldn't be sowing! iowa is retarded. St. Patrick's Day is Wednesday coolio- even thought I'm only like half Irish and you can't even tell hah Tiff is way more Irish- at leats she has red hair. OH YEAH I remembered something- on some IQ test thinger the two top scores were girls and out of everyone redheads scored the highest then blondes and then brunettes so blondes aren't so stupid after all!!! It's all those brunettes out there! geez lol And bald men scored the highest for the guys. Interesting huh?????? :D If your IQ is over 130 you're considered a genius but I don't think I'm a genius and I got like 164 on one and 142 on another- I think those were messed up though cuz they were on the website- like at Spark and stuff. Shoop doop- ahh my parents are lucky!!! They're going to Mexico over Spring Break!!!! I wanna go!!! lol I'm gonna be doing soccer everyday with Tiff- man I'm gonna die I havent playeed since 2nd grade!!! I need cleats and shingards and shorts and socks and get a physical- ahh lots of money and then what if I don't like it??? Tiff's gotta help me lol- maybe I should go running before conditioning or else it might like be too much since I never exercise or anything. 4:47- hah cool time I like it I like it a lot!!!!! ok I'm retarded- maybe we won't do anything this Friday- that would be cool if we just had a bunch of parties and stuff :D :D :D :D I like parties- maybe I'll have a birthday party forever- like at my 127th birthday Iwould still have one- maybe if I have some money I'll get everyone a granny skateboard- awesome lol. I probably won't have money though cuz I got this new idea that I want to do mission work. I've always thought that every job sounded boring or had no purpose and then these people came to my church and talked about missioning and it was like THAT'S what I want to do. But idk it might change. And Idon't think you have to go to college for that and I want to go to college so I might pick a different job. Alrighty I'll write more later....adios! 3*17*04 *AL* HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY!!!!!!! 3*19*04 *Tiff* HeYa ChOsTeRs! do you all think it's annoying when people do that or cool? just wondering, it's okay sometimes but yeah too much is annoying I guess. Well YAY! Spring break! my goosh they made us go to school for 4 straight weeks thats like a month! geez. I bought my cleats for soccer they are blue nike cleats ..my red ones were better oh well only came in E 1/2 too small for me. We have practice all spring break bleeh bleh bleh at Jackson elementary school. The goonies stay together!~ cool. SoOoOoOoOoOo what is everyone doing over spring break? Maybe you should EMAIL us eh? yeah I think yeah. Man man why does it take so long to be able to talk on this thing..like I get an idea after so much suffering of what to talk about oo soccer soccer! why would you guys care about soccer? you aren't playing?! so why do you care? why would you want to read about soccer? thats like my little thing I'm doing..I bet no one cares lol. I mean yeah I care because it's me dur but you all probably could care less gosh why do you even read this! It must be so incredibly boring reading about someone else's life!!! Hey I've got an idea why don't you TELL US what you think of our rants about things about whats going on in our lives eh? EMAIL US! lol the email address hermnerp@yahoo.com is at the bottom of the page! please tell us what you think please! OH I'd also like to recommend a good website internetjunk.org it's cool we both go there now and yeah like talk. You know if you all actually do the stuff I say and read this lte then thats sorta creepy I mean you must know a lot about us? freaky..sorta stalkerish actually lol..not really I guess since we post it online for the entire world to see and beg you all to go and read it but still...it's creepy I mean like you know so much and we know..so very little...freaky. I need a shower lol. I'm in a gang! heheheehehehe we meet every school day and we're a big cool intimidating gang. The schkrickers/shkrinkers yeah my word is the first one but my gang can't say it right they say it the other way...oh well thats cool too. Schkricker is an awesome word! Dude! It's awesome! 3*20*04 *AL* hehehe I'm on at 7:55 AM and nobody else feels the need to be on at this exact moment I guess cuz all that's on my buddy list is computers... ahhh ....I feel so alone! HA not really I just feel cool cuz I'm here and nobody is...yeah. Schkricker- I can say it- idk if I spelled it right though. I don't feel like going back and checking how to spell it. Yup along with Tiff's reccomendation- I would reccomend going to internetjunk.org too highly exciting FOR SERIOUS and you can chat with people from all over the world about debatey type stuff hmm not really chat but post stuff back and forth kind of- it's called forums but that word just doesn't make sense...... except I've only done 11 posts and Tiff's done like 80 something so I'm only a Jr. Member and she's just a Member. oh well I'll be there sometime- someday I will have the honor of being a member and when that time comes oh I will be so happy. LOL yeah my parents are in Mexico right now having a great time while Im stuck in crappy Iowa!!!!! AHHHHHHH save me the torture!!!!!! But yeah I'll have fun cuz today Tiff is coming over to play soccer around sometime I still gotta call her and tell her to bring ze hammer!!!!!! :D :D :D :D We haven't traded in a while. And I'm going to Wisconsin Dells for two days and we're planning on going bowling sometime and i might be going to a movie too so yup should have some fun over Spring Break yip yip yip My throat hurts and I keep sniffling and coughing and it's really annoying REALLY annoying!!!! AHHHHH cold's suck I like to be healthy and ENERGIZED!!!!! exclamation points are so much more exciting than periods. UMMMMMM my favorite smell is laundry detergent and Tiff's driveway always smells like it. At the mall there's this one cadle that's called clean cotton and it smells like laundry detergent!!!! Tiff likes Febreze- pretty smelly good too. Somebody let off a stink bomb at our school the other day and it smelled like sewer or dead people or something but it smelled really bad. really really bad..... it was nasty. yeah Anyways I'm kinda hungry so I think I'll eat some breakfast! I'm proud to say that I DO NOT skip breakfast like most people do- I'm a full fledged breakfast eater!!!!!!!! *Tiff* same day -I had 91 posts on inty junk :D. heheheheeh!!! I haven't eaten breakfast either...but I don't know what I'm going to have..maybe my parents went grocery shopping last night while I was gone -COOL then maybe we will have something good like Reese's puffs or something. Hey know what breakfast food is gross! The only good breakfast food is like yeah cereal what else is there? waffles no I don't like them pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausages etc..all nasty. French toast no. Toast is pretty good but only sometimes, but I LOVE cereal ....love cereal yum yum cereal is the best! heheheh! okay yeah so today I'm going to go play soccer today I don't know where...hmmmm. Yeah cuz Al hasn't played for years and years so now we are going to go practice.Cut off -nerner *AL* huh? yeah same day again lol I saw Tiff and Josh walking down Kimberly today and we honked at them and I was waving at them but they like didn't recognize the car cuz it was my sunt's and then we pulled into Walgreen's and I jumped out of the car and waved at them but they just ran away and came back and stood there so idk if they knew it was me or not.. but who else would wave at them anyways like a crazy person????? lol And then jump out of the car while it's still driving? cool I think I'm gonna go see Secret Window today- looks cool. yup yup extremly bored- we didn't get to play soccer today cuz I thought we were gonna go see a movie but we still haven't and it's 5:00 so I guess we could have played soccer but it IS really windy the ball coulda blown away maybe but err I hate when people say they're gonna do something and then they don't but I think we might still go to the movie idk I'm not really making sense just a big run-on sentence. So yup catcha later Bill and Ted!!!! oh yeah I lost my cool sheet that told how to do the accents too. :( yummy grapes........ 3*23*04 *AL* hallo again everyone!!! So my spring break's been ok.... lol I don't really feel like complaining. Today's my first day of soccer practice since I was in Wisconsn Dells yesterday. So hopefully I don't die from running so much. That would suck. lol Ok I really have nothing to write. Tiff hasn't been here in a while AHHHHH she has caught my syndrome thingy..... yeah 3*24*04 *Tiff* What're you talkin' about? I get on and type more then you do..I think so..well actually probably not. Dude it is spring break I don't want to sit at home and type on the LTE.. but of course look what I am doing right now..lol. Yeah of course. It's only like 10 am though so it's early doesn't mean that I'm gonna be stuck here doing this all day. I could find something to do. Doubt that we can go bowling blaaaaaaah gar because of weightlifting at like 2:50..too early. You know I really like playing defense...I enjoy it a lot more when I play that and not forward. Defense is way funner you just have to go and get the ball away from the person and if they pass you, you just run really fast and catch up and try again then kick it really hard wooohoo! Where is everyone? I'm on aim but nobody is on..argh. I added a quiz to my website! wooooop! Man man if I wrote on the LTE each time I got online then it would probably be really long but usually I don't because my mind is blank and I can't think of what to write about. I went to see 50 first dates last night..heheh I liked it..cute little penguin Willy and that one creepy dude. There are some parts that are pretty corny but I've seen WAAAAAY worse. I'm going to collapse at soccer practice today while we are running because my ankle is messed up and hurts and it's hard to walk even so yep definitely dead. It's supposed to rain today! AWESOME! get to play soccer in the rain..fun fun fun cooooool..heheheeheheh! 3*27*04 HEY everybody yeah no soccer in the rain but yesterday we got to jump in a huge puddle! It was cool..yesterday was cool..hm...except for like yeah it was sorta hard I guess, it didn't FEEL hard but it should have felt hard because yeah we ran 2 laps bending over and jumping up and high knees and butt kicks then had to jump over the ball back and forth and spring (I'm not so good at that one lol) and THEN we ran the mile and 40 meters and got timed BLAAAH..gar yeah then we scrimaged so actually we did a lot but it was pretty fun. ^^Take your records, take your freedom, take your memories I don't need 'em. Take your space and all your reasons but you'll think of me.^^ sort of a weird song but I got it stuck in my head yesterday. I woke up somewhat early today like 7:30 ish and yeah I like it a lot more then waking up late..it feels nice, I wish everyone in my family like didn't live with me because yeah then I could wake up like that every day and it would be nice. Wake up on my own instead of everyone screaming and yelling and waking me up blaah I hate it. GAR! I hate when they are loud before I go to bed too..I want to cut their heads off..RARR! This sucks though..spring break coming to a close..wah. lol I don't want to go back to school, 2 months left...ah my gash thats too long. Weird I just noticed at the bottom of the page there is this big thing for advanced editor? Okay I don't know what that means. Weird...where did that come from....weird. MY BROTHERS ATE MY COCOA PUFFS!!! WAAAAAAAAH!!!!! booohoooooooohoooooooooo!! I was yeah..deeply hurt..I really was...they always eat all of my cereal, like all of my food actually..it's sad. They ate my colby jack cheese too..so sad..now I'm left with nothing to eat. Don't you all feel so sorry for me? lol yeeah I'm sure. Okay I keep THINKING that I'm done typing and go to check how many K's there are and there is always 156 it's impossible to get to 157 (a way cooler number). That's FRUITY lol. heh. I kind of have a craving for bagel bites, weird isn't it? I haven't had bagel bites in forever. I think I'm going to write them on the list thingy! Yay! but we all know what will happen if I do that....they will be eaten..and not by me...RARRR!!! Stupid orangehead and that other nasty one..ew. Nerp Nerp Nerp. YaY! guys I got to 157! yay! 3*27*04 *AL* HEYA haven't written in a while.. I'm gonna try to write 13K so Tiff won't see the thingy in the E0's but idk if I can- maybe. heheh hmmmmmm blah my parent's flight got delayed- they were supposed to come home yesterday at 8:00 then it got delayed until 10:30 and then there was no more flights so they had to spend the night in the hotel and come back at 9:30 this morning but then that got canceled so now they're driving home in a rental car at this very minute. yup yeah so I haven't seen them in lik a week now- you people will probably think I'm weird for missing them but yeah I do-I like my parents. Most of the time lol. freaky it's EE degrees outside. We went bowling on Thursday and played 5 games cuz at Leisure Lanes it's only $2 per game and $1 for shoes. really cheap and way better than Bowlmor. But I got like 82- that was my best score and Tiff had like 90 something but josh got like 150 cuz he was really good that day for some reason and could do these cool spinny things where the ball curves around right by the gutter but then turns and makes a strike. yeah kind of confusing to explain- ya gotta see it. Oh yeah we made it through our first week of soccer and good news- I didn't die!!! See I'm still here typing lol. But we did the mile yesterday and it must have been a messed up mile cuz me and Tiff both were faster than we ever had been but I got like 7:25 and the fastest Iever had was 8:49 and that was in like 4th grade. Iusually get 10:00 now but not yesterday. I was proud of myself. lol yup yup yup lol ah my gash hehehehehe funny......... only 1 1/2 days left of Spring break boohooooooo argh but then we get a 4 day weekend over Easter so that's cool. Josh's birthday is April 12th so it would be cool to put stuff in plastic eggs and have an Easter egg hunt. lol maybe like some PLASTIC GRENADES!!!!! lol we got an evil bug in my house cuz it bit me or something and left this rash thing on my back that looks like a rabbit head. It's weird..... evil thing. nothing to do.... so bored where is everyone????? oh man there's physical fitness testing on Monday and all through next week gaaaaaaaah noooooo all I can do is the sit n' reach and MAYBE now the mile halfway fast but the pull-ups are impossible- never got one in my life- and the shuttle run is stupid and sit ups are just tiring. BLAH stupid things. I can't wait until the summer so we can go walking and exploring and swing on willow trees!!!! that was fuuuuuuun. WEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOO excitement time!!!!woosh woosh yippee yahahahahah yippity skippity ok that was fun. Herm ya'll should go to Tiff's evil page on her website- it's actually cool even though it's supposed to be evil so it kind of contradicts itself. Bit that's ok- that's what makes it cool. Iliek when stuff doesn't make sense. Like my signs on my wall that say No Parking and Private Drive. See? They don't make any sense. heheheh The whole back of my door is covered in the magazine pictures from the Buckle. I was really bored so now it's like a collage. They're not even that cool of pictures either. And my closet is covred in Pokemon cards. lol I'm weird. Pokemon are really old- I just like the cards. oh yeah I saw lots of movies this week- Secret Window- really stupid, don't see it, the ending sucks. umm 50 First Dates- awesome, go see it, really funny. Cold Creek Manor- stupid, boring, not what you think it is. Dickie Roberts Former Child Star- okay, kind of funny in some parts. yeah see the only one I liked is 50 First Dates. :D yum I want some spring oreos!!!! herm I'm really bored- maybe I'll get some more quizzes for my website. Wonder how much I've typed? only 160K? that's crap. I just noticed the Advanced Editor thingy too. Weird I never noticed it before. Okay it looks like I've failed my mission cuz I've run out of things to type. sorry for the evil numbers Tiff. lol *Tiff* lol Josh's birthday is April 10th not April 12th. Yeah anyway ..we have arrived at the end of Spring Break. (Oh yeah Al btw I read your email that I was supposed to read by E:00 at about 9:53 lol sorry yeah stupid Roberta never told me, oh and yeah that kind of stuff like youth group and stuff yeah better if I know in advance otherwise I'll be gone like I usually am). I went walking in the rain today, rain was nice but it was CHILLY brr, me and Josh talked about this -it's sort of weird lol- but okay what if YOU were a parent and your kids were sexually active? what would you do? I mean that is a hard situation when you think about it because theres not many good ways of handling it? WELL I only brought that up so I could ask people to send us EMAILS about what THEY would do! Thanks! Yeah even though I already know no one will answer. Okay well I think that I would have a big talk about how easy a girl could get pregnant and I would ask them if they were going to do it to just make sure they would use protection and I would even offer to buy some if they wanted me to, yeah then talk about like STD's and how about why it would be a nice choice to wait for marriage because it would be special - and if you really cared about that person -then you would wait. Yep and all that stuff like the people who go in to classes like for health classes and talk about pregnancy and STD's and all that good stuff yeah just like one of those people lol that would be me hahahahaha, but ya know the parents who would ground there kid and stuff like from seeing that person -it's sort of stupid because then the kid is just going to try harder and start going totally against the parent -it would at least be better to talk to the kid and like be on the same page and stuff rather then against each other. Hey I thought of another one -what would you do if your kid was gay? (or lesbian) thats a weird one..man..that would be uncomfortable lol. I don't even know what I would do..hm...weird. Well of course I'd accept it and stuff but it would be weird..lol. Yeah but thats your kid and if thats the way they are theres not too much you can do about it..whoa weird- hm..okay theres another one if you have an answer for the what would you do if your kid was gay question then SEND US AN EMAIL telling us in GREAT DETAIL about what you would do. Thanks all of your emails are greatly appreciated! 3*30*04 *AL* Ok hey yup I knew Josh's birthday was April 10th just a typo ya know- I always have typos... man the 2 is really far away from the 0 though- that was a really crappy typo! lol Um yeah anyways guess I'll answer these "topics of discussion" lol Um okay- if my kids were sexually active... yeah I would be REALLY disappointed because I'm hoping I'm going to be the kind of parent who talks enough to their kids and teaches them about it enough so that they don't do it until marriage and I'm planning on bring ing them up in a Christian enviroment so that would also be really disappointiong to know that they were doing that anyways. If it was my daughter and she got pregnant I would for sure have her keep the baby and help her raise it but I would have a hard time forgiving my daughter or my son but I wouldn't stop talking to them or anything or "disown" them- that's a little too harsh for your own kids. But I think that everyone can start over- and I'd work hard on helping them stay unsexually active (?) until marriage- Ialso belive that it's important to save it until marriage and have it be special for that one person. Idk I could really get into but yeah it involves a lot of my personal beliefs and I don't want to "impose" them on anyone- people sometimes get mad. lol okay If my kid were gay or lesbian.. ah man that's really hard... I would have a really hard time accepting it but I guess I would have to eventually since their my kids right? lol no I would... but yeah once again it would be realy disappointing to find out that they chose to go that route- for more than one reason... and I mean it's not that I'm discriminative against gay people or anything - it's just that I don't believe it's morally right- but I accept them and talk to them (yeah I know one gay guy) but... yeah idk it would be really really hard. bleh I don't really even want to think about it. herm oh yeah I was reading Leviticus in the Bible the other day for some reason and idk it's really weird-like kind of freaky. It talks about sacrafices and rules and stuff- it's the only Book that's ever kind of freaked me out. lol I'm planning on trying to read the whole Bible. I kind of feel bad for never doing it... okay sometimes it's hard to know what you can and can't write on this thing cuz you don't know who's reading it- I mean you'd think you could write anything right- since it's yours and all- but you can't cuz people get mad....lol today in school we did some Career Interest Survey- and you had to put your top two choices in careers- and I don't have any idea so I put Graphic Design (kind of interested in it0 and Movie Director- lol sounded cool to me even though I never plan on doing it lol. And then we had to put our top two hobbies and Iput languages and travel- there wasn't much to choose from. Yeah- we had litte choices for everything- you didn't just get to make stuff up. There was world wide web surfing too but eh I don't really like to surf- just put stuff on this website and mine, go to intyjunk, and talk on AIM. lol >>>>>>> cool <<<<<<< little arrow things.. heheh So soccer was freezing cold tday- it was like 30 some degrees out and I had shorts and short sleeves on but then Tiff had extra long sleeve shirts and sweatshirt and then my mom brought me some pants and a sweatshirt too. :D lol But yeah my body doesn't really function in the cold. AHHHH need to live somewhere warm!!! Not in stupid freezing cold Iowa!!!!!! I can't wait to leave this place- and go to Colorado!!! But hm not much warmer huh? lol oh well so yeah me and Tiff both got put on the Junior Varsity team for SOME reason- okay well Tiff's actually played before but me??? NO never played since 2nd grade!!! WHY somebody tell me WHY am I on the JV team??? I have no idea what I'm doing and the coach wants me to play some position that tells people when to move and stuff and "talks" to everyone! AHH I can't talk to people! I can't tell them what to do cuz IDK!!!! lol Idk what I'M supposed to do so how should I know what they're supposed to do??? argh it's so stupid. The sopomores should have been put on JV. Doesn't that make more sense than freshmen? yeah... but grr oh well maybe I'll get the hang of it by the end of the season! :D lol but all we do is run and do drills every single day... man I can't have repetition to much or I get BORED- yeah I get tired of stuff REALLY fast hehe but not Mt. Dew... lol I get bored and I'm impatient.. but I'm really hyper- maybe that makes up for it lol. Oh yeah we played human foozball in soccer today too- that was easy- way easier than regular soccer anyways. lol. Maybe I'll check the email and see if anybody sent anything. lol 3*4*04 HEYA! Okay getting right into it. I am feeling happy for spring coming. Usually I don't like spring, it's like a ick stupid season but this year I'm seeming to like it a lot. Weird? yeah I know. I think now that it's a happy season and I like it. I still definitely like fall muchos muchos times more because it's cool but yeah Spring isn't as bad as I always made it out to be. I really love colby jack cheese. I'm eating it now, it's good. Colby Jack stuff in case you don't know is that cheese with the yellow/white AND orange. hah awesome -it even looks cool. Like a cow sorta...a orange and yellow/white. I don't know if I should call it yellow or white because it looks more white but it feels weird saying white cheese. lol. Yeah it shouldn't I'm just weird thinking all cheese should be yellow. I checked out a Steinbeck book from the library on Friday and yeah I'm on like page 30 something and I'm already bored. BUT ya know actually I'm not sure if it's that I'm actually bored rather then just wanting a shorter book. Ya see this book is E01 pages..thats a lot. I don't want to read another book thats that long. Thats long lol. It's not AS interesting as Desperation (my Stephen King book) was either so I don't know if I'd get it done as fast as that one. That one was 547 pages and yeah I read the last 200 pages in like 2 days haha. I wonder what I'm gonna do today..no school Sunday woooohoooo! yay! I got 100 posts and Inty Junk! cool huh? I'm not very good at posting because I always think everyone else is way smarter then me and whatever I say is gonna be REALLY stupid lol which it is but I try not to sound as dumb as I am. hah. I finally got 100. Sheesh. Yeah when I first joined there I never typed anything on the message board thingers, all I did was take the quizzes from test results..heheh and put them on my website. I've been adding some quizzes lately I don't know how many there are but just saying I added some. hm I kinda want the trees to get leaves..I miss the leaves..lol. I like leaves. Leaves are nice. If you think leaves are nice then send us an email about how much you like leaves..we'd be glad to read anything you send. lol. Hahahahahahahahahahahahah. 4*9*04 *AL* hey hey hey cool we're up to 170K now!! hehe HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOSH!!! yeah not until tomorrow but hm I might not be on here tomorrow- so yeah just gonna say in advance! See I've got this thing where I wanna say happy birthday to all my friends on here on their birthdays- so far it's only been Nuong's so yeah not much of an on-going thing yet. lol But Tiff's birthday's coming up soon yeeeeeep I got her a cool thing she'll REALLY like except ya know other people wouldn't understand it at all. She already knows I got her Kung Pow- one of the greatest movies of all time along with TENG!!!!!! :D :D :D Yup tomorrow we're gonna give Josh a birthday makeover!!!! hehehe...... it'll be awesome!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHH YAAAAAAAAAY WOOOOOPPEEEEEEEE I'm so happy!!!!!!! We don't got no soccer game tomorrow cuz somehow we don't have to go!!! yip yip yip I don't think the people like us there. lol So now I'm all happy and GLEEFUL!!! lol yahoo yahoo yahoo yep yep okay I ain't really got anything to write so I'll whoosh back later uh huh uh huh uhhuhuhhuhuhhuh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *Tiff* Cool I get to type on the 172K page...yay! Josh man I never even got you anything because I spend all my free time with you or playing soccer so yeah it will be a little late lol. MAN! I'm all sunburned already and it's like April from playing soccer..everyday...EVERYDAY. Yeah I know it's awesome we don't have to go to the jv tournament tomorrow! yippppeee! I don't want to go at all blah! YaY! I don't even want to play JV I just want to play fresh soph because yep it's waaaaaaaaay cooler! JV is too serious and I'm too jokey to play it, I'm not as worried about being a really good player as I am about having a good time! A bunch of people on our team always get mad at us for laughing and stuff and talking and they yell at us and seperate us and then say they're going to make us run if you don't shut up. Yep. They get mad..eh..too serious about it, I guess some people are playing to get good but gosh..don't have to ruin ALL of my fun geez. lol. Eric is trying to get me to play forward now..I suck at it..suck at defense too though lol..but maybe not AS bad...no not as bad as forward definitely not...heheheh. Forward is hard because yeah I have problems trying to get the ball past the defenders..it's hard. I need to learn some tricks that I'll actually be able to use..heh. We learn them but I'm too retarded lol. Ah oh well. I kinda wanna switch some freshman who actually WANTS to play on JV just so I don't have to. I really don't want to, the jerseys are kinda cool but yeah I DONT CARE! Still stinks. heh I said stinks. 4*11*04 HEYA! Happy Easter Everybody! :D :D :D ^^I believe in a thing called love!^^ thats all the lyrics that I know. Okay need to get ready to go to church so I better go just wanted to say happy easter to everyone..bye! OKAY I'm back! Glowbowling was awesome! Only crap thing was that we got the last lane..maaaan. So it wasn't as black lighty as before..next time we go we'll have to reserve a lane. Oh yeah and at the beginning they were playing music that was sorta retarded. I like when they play songs I know because I sing along..heh it's fun! I'm going to Al's in like an hour for Easter cuz my family isn't doing anything..we don't ever do anything anymore with the family (YAY!!!!) hah. ^^How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad? Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad. I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral. Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve. I have a history of taking off my shirt!^^ Chickity China the Chinese Chicken, you have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'! 4*14*04 *AL* Heya everybody!!! yup haven't typed in a while- cuz yeah just been sort of busy! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TIFF!!!! Actually it's tomorrow lol but I'm not gonna have time to type tomorrow cuz of the JV game. BLAH!!! I don't like the games- I just wanna go to practice cuz then when I play in games and I mess up people yell at me and get mad. Soooo yeah games suck. And it's sort of hard for me to play in a game because there's not like one little bit of competiveness in me at all so I don't really care if we wein or lose- Ijust wanna have fun but other people kind of get mad when I think that way. Oh well too bad for them. hehehe Yup so the four day weekend totally rocked man! LOL okay well Friday we had soccer practice so that wasn't all that great but Saturday we didn't have to go to the JV game and me and Tiff and Josh all went to Tiff's house and had some fun taking pictures..... not gonna elaborate on that lol it's not gross or anything just yeah I'm not gonna say anything more lol then we went to Josh's birthday/Easter party and had jello eggs! YUM! :D and some good jalepeno cheese bread. Then glow bowling like Tiff said! I love glow bowling- it's my favorite thing now!!! then Sunday went to church and Tiff came over after that and we watched Kung Pow!! And then hahahahahah my grandma gave me this purple sweater thing- AHHHH it was really ugly and she kept telling me that I wouldn't like it even before I opened it so then I DID open it and I DIDN'T like it so I just started almost cracking up and I could tell Tiff and my cousin were gonna start cracking up so when she left the room we did and she heard us- oops. lol but then they put the stupid thing on me. AHH scary.... then Monday more soccer practice- fun fun yippie! not geez. So then we had a soccer game on Tuesday- and Tiff played for like 15 minutes and I played for 5 out of a 90 minute game- what a waste. And plus it was freezing to death so we just sat all huddled in a blanket the whole time. lol and then we stopped by Tiff's grandma's house and took a picture and stole her candy. lol So yup and now it's Wednesday woop woop man I like updated you on my whole life. lol i wish it was summer. yeeeeeah awesome song!!! >I belive in a thing called love! Just listen to the rhythm of my heart!< >Touching you... touching me.. touching you and you're touching me!!!> yeah something like that I don't really know it- just little parts of it. lol oh yeah I forgot to tell you about Brunswick and Len and Ebonite! Bruswick was this really cool bowling ball at glow bowling and Len was cool for me and Josh but Tiff didn't like him- she liked Ebonite so then we just ended up getting rid of them cuz they were repelling eachother or something. lol so yeah anyways guess I'll be backaround Saturday probably yuuuup adios!! 5*2*04 *Tiff* MAN! no one has typed here forever! It's not our fault! My whole computer got the trojan horse virus lol. No I didn't make it up, so my internet was screwed up there for awhile. I wrote a big long thing too and it didn't even save it dagget! Well hum YEAH it's May now. Only 20 days left of school (wooohooo!!) it's Sunday morning today 7:47 am. I have to leave for church in a little while so yeah not gonna really spend too much of my time on here I don't think. I'm really thirsty. Man what has happened?

I think it'd be fun. FUN FUN FUN. I always do that, just have people on my buddy list so I can look at their profiles. It's fun to read people's profiles :D :D :D. ^^Have you ever felt abandoned? felt so lost that you were stranded? just like all the walls were closing in and you were left inside. Have you ever felt like your days were numbered, stuck under a tree in thunder..seems to be no way out but there is one when in doubt.^^ Dude you know what there are only like 3 or 4 soccer games left that I have to go to! Isn't that cool? I know. Unless we go to regionals which I doubt it..sure hope not lol. I don't wannnaaaa! Today I'm going to something with Josh cuz yeah was gonna go to youth group with Al but there isn't youth group lol. Huong went bowling with us last night it was awesome it was her first time bowling and she got like E0-something! lol I did really bad the first time I went bowling lol...hehe. Allison did really really good it was because of Larry the awesome ball someone was going to throw away. CRAZY! Larry's cool. Brunswick was good for me last night he was magical lol. I think maybe Brunswick just felt a little left out because of Larry being so cool lol. He just wanted to get a little attention. Brunswick is a nice ball. lol. 5/12/04 *Tiff* HOLA AMIGOS! again! I decided today that I'm done with soccer, I'm just tired of going..it's the end of the year and I just want to be done with school and anything that has to do with school. I bet you all think I'm retarded for quitting so close to the end..like I should have just finished it right? but NOPE I don't feel like it. Dude if I'm not having fun then why in the hacky sack should I go? I shouldn't! My point in life isn't to torture myself with boredom! lol I mean geez. I don't want to waste my time out on a soccer field when there other stuff that I'd much rather be doing..which is like anything lol. No actually it's not, just that everyone on my team is too serious and stuff they all freak out if we're losing and it kinda annoys me. I mean I don't really care if we lose or not. I'm thinking that I'd be better suited playing dads club lol, yeah you think I'm stupid because it's dads club but you know what at least I'd be having fun, instead of getting all worried about losing and stuff lol. Sports in high school just take up too much of your time...they take too much commitement. I'm not a commitful type of person I don't think lol I remember Allison saying something like that before. It really depends on what it is though I mean sports? a sport isn't something thats important..it's a game. Not life or death. Yep just thought I'd update everyone about that. So what am I doin' tonight..I am DEFINITELY NOT going to the stupid awards ceremony! lol Allison is going but yeah she has academic excellence so she probably should but me psssshhh no. I think I have like Academic Recognition..I thought actually I did better lol but that is the sad truth. I'm even dumber then I thought lol. I finished my East of Eden book..I probably already put that on here huh yeah well anyway yep! Timshel means thou mayest. That was a long book duder E02 pages. WAHOO 12 more days of school thats so awesome! YAAAAAAAY! I'm also writing a story about Weber lol..it's retarded lol. I'll type it on here. **RATS AND OPERA** - Young Bryce was born many years ago to Frederick and Eleanor Weber. At their first sight of him they were filled with shame and embarassment. He has beady little eyes and freakishly curly hair. Frederick and Eleanor were rich folks and couldn't afford to be looked down upon for any reason. Frederick ran his own cottage cheese factory and made a lot of money. He was a very respected businessman. There was no need for Eleanor to work since her husband could easily pay all of the bills and still have tons of money left over. "Oh Frederick I just can't bear to look at him any longer!" "I know my dear, it's absolutely hideous!" "Oh darling please, please rid me of this disgusting thing" Right away dear! All we have to do is sign these papers..I'd be happy to dispose of the little creature." "Frederick we must be certain that no one will ever be aware of his existence!" "Oh Eleanor I would never tell! How embarassing would that be?!" *Puny little Bryce was left at the adoption agency. There he lived for the first 8 years of his life, they were just about to put him to sleep when Bob (the hillbilly who lived out in the country, sorrounding the city) came in drunk one night and said that he wanted a puppy. Bob drove a harley, drank, smoked, chewed and was absolutely obsessed with kitties and rainbows. He was a cat breeding redneck. "Well sir, this is the closest thing to a dog that we've got here." She pointed at Bryce. "Do you want it?" "I dunno ma'am that there mutt is perdy ugly and awfully hairy...I'm my afraid my ma will get her gurtle all tied in a knot if I take that one home." " Sir..please..PLEASE TAKE IT!!!!...eeehem, all it needs is a little grooming." "eh...I guess is alright. * Ma' I's gone down to the pound and those nice people gave me a pup for free! Is a hairy one! You wanna pet em?!" "Howdy sonny, where in corn tootin' didja pick up that there dog, look at theres a fleas all over that thing." Hurry up an' put it in the tub fore those fleas spread all over the house." "Alright ma'" (The next morning, at breakfast) "Well call me a foo' that thing ain't no dog is a boy sonny!" "Fool me too ma'" "So whats is name sonny?" "Came with a weird name, Bryce..sick huh ma'? "What kinda name is that? Who in the worl' names there kid Bryce?" "Tha' sounds like lice huh ma!? ha ha ha ha das funna." "I don wanna call it Bryce." "I got an idea ma' les call it ROVER! ha ha ha!" "Good one sonny! ha ha!" *Bryce-Rover had to do all of the chores that his adopter parents didn't feel like doing. He was the official pooper scooper of the house. He woke up every morning with the rooster and did all his chores..then..it was to school. Bryce-Rover was the nerd at school. In elementary and junior high school the kids would make fun of his hair, and his beady little eyes, they made fun of him because his feet were too big for his body and he was skinny and easy to push around. They also made fun of his allergies..because he was deathly allergic to cats, at home he had many coughing fits and had to be rushed to the hospital because of his Uncle Bob's cat breeding business. It got so bad that Bryce-Rover had to sleep in the barn with the cows..eventually he got fleas again which was just another thing that the kids made fun of him for. *When Bryce-Rover went into high school the jokes got even worse. He never could get a girlfriend..or any friend at all. The kids brought cats to Bryce-Rover's barn just to torture him. Many more runs to the hospital were made. He didn't participate in anything at school except for track. Bryce-Rover was a good runner, he could run fast. He became a fast runner from all the times in elementary school when the kids made fun of him and tried to beat him up. He always ran away from them. He ran away from Uncle Bob's evil cats also..because if he didn't..he would surely have been dead. * Bryce-Rover watched the evil cats (from a distance of course). He watched how they would attack the little rats on the farm. They were evil to the rodents..just like they were evil to Bryce-Rover. Bryce-Rover began taking rats from all over the farmhouse and bringing them to his barn to live with him. He'd try to save them from the evil cats. The rats were his only friends..and he longed for their companionship. *He never had gotten along with either of his adoptee parents. Grandma was obsessed with being a cowboy (or cowgirl..however you want to look at it.) Even at 78 years old she still wanted to ride the bull in the rodeo. She sang country music every night before dinner..which was always pork and beans. She tried to teach Bryce-Rover to be a good horse rider but he definitely sucked at it. She also tried to teach him the banjo and how to sing country songs but he sucked at that too. She told him he was a loser and he'd never amount to nothin'. One night she brought him to a country concert and took him up on stage to sing a duet with her. When it was his turn to sing he busted out some opera and thats when she kicked him out of the barn. It was the only time Bryce-Rover had ever stupid up for himself to anyone. He finally got out of his cowardly shell and rebelled..that was the only time in his life too..he never again would stand up for himself. He's a wishy washy pushover. Before he left the barn he went back and took his friends (the rats). *Bryce-Rover went to college and dropped the Rover. In college he majored in singing, he sang opera and listened to classical music. He hates country music. He was in the choir at his college. He now teaches in Iowa. He sings opera still in his free time and is on a quest to save all the rats of the world. He has rats from all across the globe shipped to him. He goes out looking for rats on days he doesn't have to teach. He has little tubes running through his entire house, and furniture in them so the rats stay comfortable. The rats can stay in the tubes or run around freely, whatever the choose. He names each rat in his house and knows them all personally. They have access to his fridge and his bathtub. They watch his TV, and get to control the remote. Bryce would never argue with his rats, for he loves them too much. The rats are treated like royalty which in his eyes they are. Weber lives like that for the rest of his life and when he dies he leaves everything he owns to his rats. He sure does love them rats..the only friends..he ever had. THE END! I might change some parts later..idk...it's sorta messed up and kinda short maybe I'll add to it eh? HEHE 3*13*04 *AL* ah my gash I haven't typed on here forever! Dude! Tiff your story so totally ROCKED! lol Crush... umm yeah but it was really really cool- my Flinker story really sucked. I can't write at all. Blah. Oh man this stuff I'm drinking tastes like beer. It's sparkling white grap juice but bleh it's kind of nasty. Larry is awesome! I swear he's gotta be magic cuz I never even got over 100 before and I got like 130! And everybody else did really good too. I can't belive someone was gonna throw him away. Geez. Hmmm we gotta but our amiga Cong a bida present tomorrow... hey Tiff wanna just ride home with me and then we'll go from there? I heard she wants the Usher CD and monkey stuff and a hat...... okeeee ANYWAYS me and Tiff and Josh are all planning on making this awesome movie about either 3 armless people or I'm the armless person and they're the people from Josh's stories. (Refer to Josh's LTE. lol) Yeah but the three armless people story would go like Josh finds out that he has magical superhero powers to he calls this meeting for all the armless people of Davenport. It turns out we're the only three. But on the day we're supposed to meet only Tiff and Josh show up so they go looking for me and they find me and I'm a hobo and i'm pretty what the hacky sackish ya know, but we all have powers and we all turn into superheroes. And since we can't use our hands we got special types of shoes- like a whole closet full- and some our jet-pack shoes and some are eating shoes and some are parachute shoes etc. But they all got special air posket hole things that hole stuff and we can put stuff in. yuuuuup yipper skipper! 11 days left of school! Freshman year went by really fast. On Saturday I go to E Flags from E:00 am to 2:00 am but it takes 4 hours there and 4 hours back so we're actually THERE for 12 hours. Superman's gonna awesome and the giant drop. i'm going with Asian Club yip yip! But Tiff's not going cuz E is Evil right so there could be evilness there. She wouldnt go even though I tried to convince her we'd protect her from the evil. Flinker fell off the crappy bus! hehehehe that's what you say when something is crappy- it fell off the crappy bus!!!! lol hahaha she reminds me of this retarded joke that was on my Laffy Taffy the other day- What did the tree say to the math teacher? do do do dododo do do do do do do do dadadadada do do do....(Jeopardy theme) Gee! I'm a tree! (Geomety) yeah hahahahaha idk I guess it's sort of funny- but the cactus/chicken one is way cooler!!!! ahhhhh there's a breadstick on my plastic Olive Garden cup!!! Now I'm craaaaaving breadsticks! Breadsticks are muy muy riquisimos! i was thinking about nasty meat and I think the top 5 grossest meats are: 1) hot dogs! AHHH the nastiness of cow pig and chicken combined into one! 2)brown shwager/liver- groooooooosss need I say more? 3) bologna- also all kinds of animals mushed into one- and it tastes really gross too! 4) meatloaf- yuuuuuck the old fashioned home-made meat but it tastes so disgusting and dry that it would make me sick! 5) ummmm well I can't really think of a 5- I could say steak but ya'llmight maul me so um yeah. lol (Secretly though, that's number 5) oh man 2 days ago I was dumping my tray at the flowing river of garbage and my baked pasta/strawberry syrup/milk/potato/potato gravy mixture splattered up on to the lunch lady's chin and she was like "Thanks a lot!" So I got freaked out and ran away but I was cracking up the whole time- haha it was really funny. But now I'm freaked out by the lunch lady- so I run and dump my tray into the flowing river of garbage really fast and hope she doesn't see me. Scary Movie 3 came out on Tuesday and I bought it right after school! It rocks my socks! I think like the funniest part is when Cindy and Brenda are talking in Brenda's classroom and all the sudden a box of crayons whams against the wall and Brenda says " Now who the f*** was that?!" Yeah sort of bad but idk the way she says it is really funny so me and my brother watch it over and over. lol Ahhh the breadstick is still staring at me! He's torturing me... please make it stop! Gina Grape is also staring at me but she isn't torturing me as much as Bene Breadstick is. Oh okay I guess there's also Ollie the Olive, Ricky Ravioli, and Tonya Tomato but the only one I noticed was Bene Breadtsick and now he won't leave me alone. I wish I could drive because then I would go drive up to Olive Garden and get me a breadstick. Haha I remembered this weird dream I had last night- I was at my grandma's house for some reason and I had to sing Cotton Eyed Joe in front of these judges at her house. Well I had searched and searched for the Cotton Eyed Joe music so that I could sing to it (I guess it never occured to me in my dream that I have it on a CD) but anyways I went around looking for it everywhere and I finally found a music video of Cotton Eyed Joe so I put it in and get ready to sing it for the judges but the music video turns out to be this old guy playing on a banjo singing this really weird messed up version of Cotton Eyed Joe and all the judges give me really weird looks and I start making up a really weird dance to it and start knee-slapping around the room. hehe lol oh what a messed up unconscious brain I have. We were thinking that Flinker's gonna assign us this huge assignment over the summer-like a review so we don't forget or something and then leave us her address or something or she'll some to our house and demand the review and when we don't have it she'll get her shaky mad voice and go all psycho on us. I really could imagine her doing that. Freaky. Okay doke type more some other time 5*18*04 *Tiff* HEY! everybody hows it going? I'm drinking mt.dew and it's 3:07 and I'm definitely not playing soccer right now isn't that awesome! DUDE it's so nice not having to go everyday anymore! Don't get me wrong or anything heheheheh I do like soccer it's fun, I enjoy it, but everyday is too much especially since there isn't really anyone on the team I talk to..so yeah this is great. I am doing this blunt truth thinger...it's weird but yeah asks you 20 questions and you answer them, everyone should make one then send it out in an email alright? so I can do it MWAHAHAHAHAHA! http://www.blunttruthgame.com/showratings.cfm?uid=1062733 that one is mine)stupid thing has to have an E in it arrrrgh! but it has a 27 thats pretty cool because yeah it's like almost 72, that can cancel it out..lol. Hum what to write on here now? There are only 8 days left of school! Dwindling down..hehehe coool!

AH my gash dude. I always put Britian and just today I learned that I am a retard and I always just thought I was right when really I'm just wrong and stupid and wrong. It's Britain not Britian. Agh. Britian looks better to me. Oh well. Looks aren't everything ;D lol. I'm on AIM and I'm actually on RexRocks72 man I haven't gotten on that for awhile now. Holy Toledo huh?! Yeah I know. I have too many screen names to count. Not really..but I can't really remember them all. 391-8384. ^^Shot down said you never had the chance took a ride on a suicide romance.^^ 5*22*04 I had a funny dream where yeah it was funny..hehehe. Al and me were going into Toys R Us and we went to the candy machine and I went and just pulled one and tons of candy came out so we went around and pulled them all and all this candy came out it was cool. Then yeah her grandma (but it wasn't actually either of her grandmas) told us that we couldn't have any candy and so like we decided to leave it around the store for little kids to find and be happy because they have candy.Okay then evenentually we left the store and it was all wet outside with lots of puddles and we were playing in the puddles. Then right by toys r us was some kind of really long race track all you could see was how it went off into the distance ya know. Then we got put into a race and it was like a tag team thing like yeah it was cool. There were 4 other teams and they all sucked. We had go carts and had to race them in one race and in a nother we had like these motorized scooters and you had a passenger on the scooter it was cool lol. Then whenever I finished the race I always was running instead of driving and I always flipped to get one of the flags and I'd get the high one but it would be the wrong flag because for some stupid reason each team had there own flag and I never got MY flags team....ugh...lol. Yeah thats the dream pretty much ...weeeeeird. 5*23*04 *Tiff Again* hehehehe LTE WOO LTE WOO LTE WOO!!!!!!!!!! Gotta get pumped up! WAAAHOOOO!!! I'm listening to yellowcard they're cool. They are.

SO Al is off to Arizona today and Josh is at some golf thing so that leaves me BORED. July is a busy month all of us are gonna be doing stuff. SO! summer has been fun so far, trying to think of stuff to do everyday is pretty hard you know since it's IOWA and all but we manage lol :D. Huong's bida is coming up and me and Al got her a present already (together). It looks really small but there are a couple of thingers in it..so yeah it isn't as tiny as it looks. Man I forgot how hard it is to type on this thing, it's hard coming up with stuff to ramble about. It's hardER now since it's summer and there isn't school, usually during school I can at least blab on about the Flinker or something and her evilness but nope because I haven't seen Flinker in a month! (YESS!!! PARTY!) It's raaaaaining out :D man I don't know what to do! I should play in the rain but don't really feel like doing anything because of my sunburn. DUDE I'm the hugest wuss, I can't stop whining and complaining about a stupid little sunburn ugh! I'm annoying myself so it probably annoys everyone else too. OOO I have to tell about Larry's bida party! His bida is like May 1st but we had the party like June 27th or something but yeah whatever anyway it was AWESOME! We made a cake that was supposed to be the shape of a bowling ball but kinda wasn't really it sorta was retarded lol, but still COOL, and it was extremely rich like extreme extreme like Al got sick from eating 1 piece and even Josh could only eat 1 piece. I didn't even finish my piece lol. We fed some of it to Larry lol, we got pictures. haaa it's sooo coool! :D :D :D Everyone probably thinks we're all retarded..heheheh :D. Then the next day we went bowling with Larry. Allison made him a blanket for his birthday...haaa awesome. It was lots of fun! Okay thats enough for today just updating everyone...=] 7*17*04 *Tiff* Hey everybody! again! I'm just typing on the LTE before I go downstairs to take a shower. Josh left for his camp thing last night, it sucks. Now me and Allison are here for like a week then we leave and will be gone for 10 days. In COLORADO! SO COOL! Tomorrow at church we find out the details, hopefully. lol. Were gonna be camping in the rocky mountains lol. Cool duuuder. I haven't typed on the LTE forever, I just keep updating my xanga lol. The poor LTE is like gone man.. I need to make LTE page 2. I think I'm gonna do that (maybe) after I take a shoer, if I feel like it. If you come on, however, and there is no LTE page 2! Then it means I didn't feel like making one. If there is then that is a suprise lol. So I guess we are all moving ya know? so my parientals lol told me that by time I get back we might be selling our house. So I have to take a bunch of pictures off the walls and I have to take all personal items down, which hugely sucks! RAR! I gotta pack everything up in boxes and the house we are supposedly gonna move into but not positive isn't gonna be done being built until the end of September! GAH! lol No personal stuff til September gosh darnit that sucks lol. Then I don't even get my room I have to wait until they build me a room. Rar. lol. Okay I'm gonna go take a shower then adios!7*17*04 *Tiff* Okey then! HOLA! Look like I made a page 2 after all. I wonder what Allison is doing right now. I am kinda bored, I think she is busy today though like her family wants her at home. Yeah, I don't know. I should call and ask. LaLaLa I'm trying to fill up the page! Yeah right! Not gonna work! Doo-Doo-Doo. Our iMoods have been the same mood forever!Maybe I should change mine. ha. Okay I'm gonna try to call Allison and yeah see what she's up to today. Okay gonna go, but I'm pretty bored so I might be back here later. Adiiiiiiiios! Okay nevermind. I called and she isn't home. Argh, now I'm bored..lol. 7*21*04 HALLO! HUM. We leave for Colorado in 2 days and yeah I have this big old bag full of stuff and I don't know what I'm gonna do because it's humongus and yeah how am I gonna get there. Oh my gosh. Allison is not contributing to the LTE, she is writing some story for some reason I think it's like to get back at Josh idk what it is, and yeah I am gonna read it when she is done then I can tell you all what it is about or maybe she can just tell you except no because she isn't going to contribute to the LTE, oh my gosh. lol. Lalala. I want to leave for Colorado nooooow! lalala! Oh my gosh. I am so bored, my house is so boring, there is nothing to do, oh my gosh. Lalala. 7*21*04 *AL* Hey I just got done writing my story. It's awesome. Tiff's reading it right now. It's a story about trolls. Well yeah I was just writing it for no reason mostly. but yeah I was sort of pretending to be mad at Josh cuz when I was in Arizona I sent him and Tiff a postcard but when he's away I didn't get a note blaaaaah. oh well I wasn't really mad anyways. I like never get mad. If I do it's not for real just sarcastic madness. I'm going crazy.........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D YUM Tiff brought in some scrumptious bread! lalalalalaalal better go eat some. *Tiff* Hey guysssss I'm BORED. It's later, it's like 8-ishhh now. Al's gone. YIP YAP. Sooooo hum. lalala! I've been doing that a lot lately. Alright so I made the LTE part 2 isn't that cool? because I always try to go to our LTE (yeah right, now always, rarely) but anyway yeah and it never comes up because there is SOOO much to load and all ya know? yeah. It takes too long and it started to bug me so I decided instead of making it take longer each time by typing more and more that I'd just make a different page..nifty huh? :D :D :D Yep. I wonder if I already talked about this..lol. That'd be funny, I just repeat the same thing over because I can't think of anything else..hah. It tis hot my goosh gosh gosh. Well I packed today. For my tripper to Colorado. 10 days. I love Colorado. The trip is pretty strict though. They have 11 amendments lol. The ride there is gonna be really really boring too..ha. I can't wait to go to Colorado! I can't wait to get back either! lol I am looking forward to both! :D :D :D Alrighty then dudddderrss I'll MAYBE type tomorrow, idk, depends if I have time..lol, yeah right I'll have time, depends if I remember!

Haven't eaten, or showered, or done anything except play on my computer of course, oh Josh called too and I talked to him for 2 minutes lol but yeah otherwise haven't done anything. So now I'm typing on the LTE page 2! because we needed one! I have nothing to type lol...tomorrow at this time I'll be on a long long long long boring ride to Colorado..and it's going to be very boring lol. Maybe I'll get to know some of the people that I'm going with, that would be good, since yeah I don't really know them, never really talked to them AND I have to spend 10 days with them. So yeah...should get to know someone. Sooo I actually have some stuff to do today! It's raining...hehehe isn't that cool? rain rain rain. Okay yeah I have to go to the bank and get mula for food and showers lol. I have to take the book and the notes to Josh's house that me and Al did/made/wrote. I NEED to take a shower tonight, kinda late, so it will last a few days because yeah showers cost $2.50! Holy cow! Yeah I know. I have to clean my room and put all the stuff away in like shelves and stuff, well not everything, just some stuff...I already took everything down. So just whatever is left..Yeah and I have to go buy 2 waterbottles lol to bring on the tripper. Then I have some extra stuff to pack too. Then I am gonna call Josh and talk to him because yeah it will be 10 days til I see him. So gonna talk to him a little bit. Then yeah I'm gonna hope that Allison can give me a ride because if she can't then I don't know how I am going to get to church...uhoh! Alright I should get something to eat. Thats enough rambling for now..eh? lol yeah alright I'll type later like maybe later today or maybe when I get back. Adios! 8*24*04 *Tiff* Heya Heya everybody I'm back again. School starts on the 30th...ahhhh!!! School is the gayest thing ever. Ommmmmygooosh I'm so bored. Josh is out golfing and Allison is in Illinois with her mom idk what for but yeah, so I have absolutely nothing to do today and it's so boring. If I had a posterboard then I could make a clue game but I don't. My parents can't drive me anywhere either because we don't have a car that can drive because it has a flat tire and so I'm stuuuck here!!!! noooooooo! Darnit. lol. Booooring Booooring just sitting here. So I decided to come back to the ever-famous LTE. We don't type on here much this summer, I type all the time on my xanga site instead.. HEY! Thats a pretty good idea, I could make a xanga out of the LTE, then everyone would know what went on everyday. DARNIT! I can't because I don't have the right dates...darnit! lol. Oh well...maybe we can make another LTE for this upcoming year except it can be on a xanga site because that would be easier but nah not really though because that wouldn't really be an LTE...man. All my ideas aren't working. I was going to go play clue at Allison's today except her brother couldn't play anyway so we wouldn't have been able to play. She made her clue game with Her, Angie, Chad, Josh and me in it as the people but yeah idk who the other one is because there is supposed to be E but oh well. Better without E anyway. I am going to make mine out of like Flinker and Weber because that will be funny. I don't know what other people to put in it...just know Flinker and Weber mwahahhaahhahahahahha! welp anyway I am gonna go on xanga now and I have nothing to do anyway so yeah guess I'll go on there and do absolutely nothing in my boredness ahhhh! lol 9*11*04 hey everybody... it's the third anniversiary of the Twin Towers fall down. I haven't heard anything about it so far though. I gotta go to my aunt Becky's wedding reception tonight. That should be fun. Man I haven't typed on here forver. I kinda lost interest. If we printed out our Lte page 1 it would be 75 pages long. pretty cool huh? well yeah I'm bored. lol adios 9*12*04 *Tiff* as you all should be aware, school has started up again, so the LTE! (AWEESOMENESS) lol I'm so retarded, but anyway should be back! except Allison is bored of it so it might be a solo trail for awhile ahead. Homecoming is this upcoming Friday, I'm going with Josh. (yay) and we're gonna have an awesome time. I am wearing Sara's awesome Mexican red dress thingy it's soooo cooooL! lol I'm excited! :D yay! Well anyway, need some more rambling to prolong the LTE even more. Gosh, the LTE is so classic. HM. New news? well, I've been going to Pine Street for abouta month now. Coolio, lol. ANNND... yep. 10*25*04 Heya guys. School has been obviously torturing us all, and idk why but I just decided to come here. It's a stupid Monday. School is retarted. I don't have much to say. So this is just going to be a short little entry thing. 12*15*04 *Tiff* Oh my Oh my! How I forgot the woundrous LTE!! How dare I?!?!?!?!? Thats just terrible. Well today I was in 2nd period, which is Mr.Wolf, which is Computer Graphics, and we went to the art show thing...and so we were in this computer room that is actually for "advanced computer graphics" blah...but we were there and on the computers and I kept trying to go to a bunch of websites but I couldn't! It was just crrraazzzyy! lol. heheheheheh. Anyway though all my websites were blocked but then! I remembered! Angelfire isn't blocked! So I got on there and then I couldn't even remember the password to hermnerp, man I still got to find it...but anyway..yeah..whatever..I wanted to write on the LTE really bad because it's been a super long time, but I couldn't so now I have JUST gotten home from school and I am writing on the LTE. Isn't that wonderful? I think so too. Well whats going on in my life? I don't know...everything is pretty fine and dandy I guess. Winter break is in like a week...YAY. So I am excited for that! Ummm..I'n kinda feeling for some food right now. I almost don't want to go to Pine Street because there is going to be a cookie eating contest, I hate eating contests..ew..make me want to puke. So I'm not going to do it. BlAHH. I don't even want to watch it. Hopefully the cookie thing is BEFORE 7:45 and then after it there will just be a nice normal thing like every Wednesday...I hope so. The food fight thing would have been fun though! Weeeee. I got my Christmas Cards! and I sent Tina her Christmas card too! I just realized how bad I got at babbling. My LTE is like down in the gutter because I haven't been updating it...and well Allison hasn't been on it for like a year..lol. I think I got on it at least..once..during summer. Oh yeah and the LTE2 I got rid of because the point of the LTE is to be all on one page, so yeah the second page was just messing it up...so I had to fix that. Now it's all on one page 217k. We haven't been bowling in forever. It's so funny how everything is named Larry now, all after Larry the wiffleball from that one day of gym..way back in 8th grade. 8th grade, ahh those were the days. I decided that Mrs.Mckay was really cool, probably one of my favorite teachers...she was neat, and nice. I have gotta keep going! practice by blabbing. I have a xanga now. I've had once since May. It's pretty close to the same thing as this, except just a titty bit different... hehehehehehehehh. Oh well... So Tina moved to California! I didn't update on that...um...yeah. We'll just have to wait and see if I type on the LTE again, or if it ends up being a one-time-thing..where it'll be like 2-3 months before you hear from me again..ooooo mysterious!!! eat.your.heart.out. :P hheheheheehe. I'm back already! Hah! It's been like 2 minutes or something! Hah! I'm so crazy! hah! Okay whats up again everyone. Everything is good over here and stuff. Lets see Lets see. Oh yeah man I never even told you all that we go to pine street I don't think geez what kind of crappy informer person am I anyway? Pretty darn CRAPPY! Whooooo's yooour dddaaaaaaaadddddddyyy!!! Who's your baby, who's your buddy, who's your maaaaan!! lol don't comment on that guys, it's a song that none of you will know, just me becaues I'm a loser. Hey guys I had 2 planerians Pablo and Bartholomeu, I like Bartholomeu spelled like that more then like Bartholomew...so just...spell it my way..lol. Then guess what? they died, and I was sad, seriuosly, I almost was crying about having to cut them in half, even ask Josh! He was there..I was breaking down over some planerians and they're like teeny tiny. We dissected a bunch of stuff in that class. <>. Like, a squid, a clam, starfish, earthworm, ascaris...none of you know what an ascaris is, it's a worm, except without segments..lol...it's really not all that great..lol. Earthworms are cooler. They should have named it buttpoop instead of ascaris, because it is a buttpoop. Actually I don't hate them that much, I just over exaggerated, I always do that. lol. I said I ALWAYS do that, and when I said that, I was overexaggerating again. Ha.Ha.Ha. You know I'm spending my time typing this when I already have a different paper that I'm supposed to be typing. Kinda..dumb...isn't it. My poor typing fingers are going to be so tired! Gosh! lol. Allison's tradition-annual Christmas Party is this Friday and I'm PuMpEd!!! booyaaa! sHIZ bIZ..lOl. hahaha Josh says that a lot. I bought Josh a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers shirt for Christmas. John said it was b/a...I hate when people say b/a. like they actually say B.A. though...it's like man man if you're gonna do that then you might as well have just said it....shut up. Oh you know whats even WORSE!!?!!?!??!? When people say J/K. but they SAY J.K. oh my gosh don't ever do that or I'll eat youuuuuur eyeball out of it's socket then puke it up into your shoe then you'll step into it BAHAHAHHAAHHAHAAHA! seriously though, actually don't ever do EITHER of those...EVER. heh. "Well have a good day everyone, I'm going to type my paper! Bye! :D 8*17*06 *Tiff& Does this thing still work? GUESS WHO IS BACK! It's me!!! HA! Dang it has been a stinkin' long time since I have been on this thing. I can't believe that we gave up on the famous LTE. All of that junk mail from our fans is piling up in our mailbox... wondering why it has been 2 years since we have been on? It was just a long lunch break guys, but the dynamic duo is back in action..ready to please. So what has been going on I know you are wondering? WELL.. NOT MUCH at all! It's Senior Year now! Which sucks. Allison and I still suck at life! We have a couple new friends, lots more enemies.. you know, life is life. We work at a racist..sexist.. ice cream store! I just drank a strawberry soda and went glow disc golfing. I am not as good at rambling as I used to be, because it is hard for me to think of something to say on this right now...it has been so long too, and I still can't think of what pointless thing to say? UHHH... I don't know..this is hard. School is about to start, sucks, Flinker retired... DID YOU KNOW~!?!?!?!? I kNOW!!!! She did last year.. it is crazy! As sad as it sounds, I miss the Flinker. She wasn't so bad...esp after Scovil almost failed me in precalc. lol. That's a good story, if you like me enough, you should ask me to tell it.... UMMMMM blah blah blah. bye guyses. 5*21*07 *TIFF* BoO! 7*14*07 *AL* Hey guys!! It's good to be back. This thing has so many good memories stored on it. Tiffany and I graduated! It's crazy. She's going to St. Ambrose and I'm going to UNI but I know we'll still be going strong all through college. Don't worry, loyal readers, we will keep this thing up for years to come. lol until next time...adios 10*1*07 *AL* Oh my goodness, when I read this thing, it makes me want to cry. It makes me so happy. The years documented on this LTE were the absolute best years of my life. Tiffany, Josh, and Allison. We had so much fun... as you can see from reading this awesome website. We did so many crazy things... dead frogs, sewers, watermelon fights, farting mud, cliff jumping, Maquoketa Caves, the drive-in, Social Circles, the dance channel, garage sales, 5 Points, the train tracks, Farm Flakes, Tae Bo, the Sacred Mountain Dew, Ze Hammer, Larry the bowling ball... it makes me overwhelmingly happy to think of those years of my life. We didn't have a care in the world, and we just hung out everyday and loved each other to no end. We didn't have to worry about jobs or college or any of that. I would give anything to go back. I miss doing random things and acting like little kids. I miss having only enough money to buy one Choco Taco to split bewteen two people. I miss having to walk everywhere because we couldn't drive. I miss going to Pine Street High every Wednesday night. I miss going to the drive-in with Jody and Brian. I miss having garage sales and being psyched that we made $80!!! I miss it all. Why do we have to grow up? Getting older just really isn't any fun at all. Not as fun as these years of my life. I am so glad we are all still friends because I don't know what I would do without some piece of this part of my life. I love them both. Josh and I don't talk that much anymore, but when we all hang out, it's still so much. Tiffany- I love her so much, and I know we'll be friends always. We're already making plans for her wedding.. I'm pretty excited to plan some kickin' parties. haha I can imagine the three of us... maybe four if my husband is cool... but we are all sitting together when we're like 90 and laughing about all the good times we had when we were kids. Maybe we'll get out Social Circles to play or maybe turn on the Dance Channel and dance our hearts out. All you need in this life are true friends. I'm so glad I found them when I did because they made my life so unbelievably memorable. I wouldn't trade that part of my life for anything. We'll try to keep up this website, so all of you, our dedicated readers (haha) can know how things pan out for us throughout our lives. I can tell you with no doubt, that anytime you check back, we will still be great friends. :)11*17*09 *TIFF* Hey there amigos! I thought I'd do an update on our lives now! Hahaha. SOOO. Allison and I are roommates up at UNI, we're both juniors. I'm going to be a spanish teacher and she is a spanish major and she just switched from teaching so she has got her own stuff going on but all she really wantsta do is open a Mexican restaurant or a pet shop or something. Anyway! As you can see we haven't changed very much! I see Josh a lot lately, he is thinking he is going to go into the Air Force this spring and I'm pretty sad about it but I try to be a good support! I don't know how I used to type so much on this thing I am having a hard time thinking of stuff right now and it has been years since I've talked to you! I have been teaching at a school and it's pretty weird cause it wasn't that long ago that I was in high school! Some of the kids remind me of me and my friends. It's pretty funny, sometimes I hate it, but I hope it turns out for the best because I've already put a lot of time and effort and MONEY into it so I don't want to turn back now! haha. Anyway we're all healthy and sane as ever ;)

Hello, everyone! This is one of the weirdest sites: or your money back! We have ZIM, neopets, music, and much, much, more. E-mail us for questions, comments, complaints and information. Why not click on the Very Weird Stuff link to see more, or click on the music link? We have halloween and christmas pictures on the NeoPics link. Cheese is not a wild thing!!!!!!!!! Now I have decided to go for a world record. I will try to make the longest web page ever, made completely out of text! Won't that be fun? I will just type, and type, and never, ever use copy and paste. Wow...I really must be bored. Just goes to show what boredom can do to you. Any way, that's it for now. Wait, no it isn't, I still have to keep going, and going, and going. Because I do. THE REST OF THE STUFF I TYPE WILL BE COMPLETLY IN CAPS JUST BECAUSE I CAN. THAT IS ALL. SEEYA! Hi, I'm back. So far this is nowhere near the world record. I think. I don't exactly know where it is...oh, well. I'll just have to do the very best that I can. No one is really coming here, anyway. So it doesn't matter. By the way, TAB is a worthwhile, community-service organization. The form link is to a 100% fake TAB registration form that you can fill out just for laughs. I can't believe I'm bothering to do this. I have very low expectations of my site. None ever comes here, I could do this all day long and I still wouldn't have any more hits. This is just a pointless excursive in spelling errors and grammatical imprecision. May your day be shiney! The following is an extremely weird poem-thingy that I wrote when I was in a relatively weird mood:
never mind that noise my dear can anyone pass the cheese only if you say pretty please oh, boy do I have to sneeze. why must everyone always rhyme, why I’m a poet and don’t I know it? what I fear comes right after here not this life or the next will I ever be able to pass the test? we’re stuck in here, (alone my dear) and we’ll problem never get out so don’t start to shout. it’s dark and I want to go home is where the heart was where is it now? we’ll never know but oh crap it’s starting to snow and it’s time to show and tell about the well that you found last summer at camp when it was damp it was near the ramp oh god why must this be I liked that tree but now it’s gone, farewell so long I’ll miss you as long as you write but then I’m afraid to say good-night. my dear there’s nothing to fear that’s only a box that’s made of blocks next to the wagon that looks like a dragon why are you shaking it’s your fear that is making you shiver and act all a quiver. don’t you know that you only need be afraid of fear and never anything here and certainly not a post that acts like a ghost?
See, very weird. At least it fills up my word quota for the day. Not that I exactly have a word quota for the day. It just sounded very professional to say it. Anyway, I still don't think that anyone is actually coming here. You'd have to be an absolute loser (or really bored) to come here. I'd probley come here, but that isn't much of a surprise. After all, I've been to the Really Really Big Button That Doesn't Do Anything website over 50 times. Pathetic. But, whatever. As long as I'm happy, right. Humor the crazy person, okay? Oh, guess what? According to someone you problem don't know, this is the second most pointless website ever! Next to the Really Big Button, of course. I feel special. Come on everyone, group hug. Okay, now I'm starting to scare myself...I'm gonna quit for today. Seeya. Now I'm back. Is this getting confusing to you? Too bad. Now I want you to go to http://quiz.ravenblack.net/blood.pl?biter=eon" If you do this I'll get points in the game. Come on all you non-existing people! Help me! You know you want to! It's a worthy cause! Honestly, the more time I waste playing the game, the less time I'll work on this site and the less stuff you gotta read. Although why you'd be here if you didn't want to read is beyond me. Maybe you're lost. Okay, if you want to get out, click the little refresh button, okay? Good...what? You say it didn't let you out? Oh, well. You must be caught in a time warp. Keep pressing it. Maybe you'll break free. What's that. The little counter at the bottom keeps going up? Never mind. That's just how many times you have to click before you can leave. Good-bye.

Hey, I'm once again: back. I don't suppose you fell for that little thing about the refresh button. After all, you're a responsible, intelligent person who apparently has a lot of time on your hands. Well, you can't possibly have more time than I do. I mean, after all, I made this site. You're only browsing it. And most people don't even come here. Not even my friends...*sniffle* The just ignore this poor, pathetic little page. All they do is fill out the TAB form and leave. I think. Maybe they're here right now! HI! HOW ARE YOU DOING? I'M FINE! THANKS FOR COMING! YES, I'M YELLING! Who am I kidding. This page won't get a single hit, unless I bribe people...now that has possibilities. Okay, fill out the TAB form, so I have proof that you bothered to come here and...uh...I'll...uh...send you a sandwich? Please allow 6-8 weeks for delivery. I'm bored. I'm gonna go hug a moose. MOOSE! I love-d you moose! Hey, I'm back again! Yea...*waits for applause* okay! Now I want all you loyal fans...*cricket chirps* to go to the link to see what I'm like. I took a whole bunch of personality quizzes and posted them there. I'm an evil villain, kitty and a freakazoid so far. And I only took the quiz once, too. Spooky how accurate they are...anyway, I command you to go! I'm going. I'm back. I'm gonna start counting how many times I say back. Let's see: 1...2...3...4...5! Wow. I must really be desperate for something to do. I now officially have proof that someone has been here! It was one of my friends. Apparently this page really is getting long, because my friend said something to that effect. Maybe. Anyway, moving on! I'm just basically typing nothing. Just like all those reports people have to do. You know? With a specific number of words. They start out with half that number, and then just fill in words until they have the right amount. I salute those people. You're great tradition is being carried out here, on the second most pointless site ever! Well. Maybe eventually some weird, bored person will wander onto my site on accident and be mildly entertained be my site until they wander onto a live video feed of a coffee maker. Or maybe not. I only know that I'm entertaining me, which was my original goal. So. I've done what I've set out to accomplish. Yea, me! I'm so special. You see, most people, they don't like reading or writing. So if you're not most people, you've made it down this far without skipping, skimming or getting the spark notes version. (Which I think does not exist) My point is, if you've bothered to read this, then, (like me) you probley have also read the ketchup bottle so many times that you have it down verbatim. Look verbatim up. It's a word. But, you should know that, since you like reading. Or maybe you're just skimming. Anyway, there's nothing wrong with reading food labels. You might be asked a question about them on a quiz show. And now, for the million-dollar question: How many calories are there in a single serving of Mustard? I can just see it now...It could be called Know-Your-Food. Or You are What you Eat. It'd probley be as popular as those game shows that no one's ever heard of. Speaking of food, what's up with pie? There's strawberry pie, apple, pumpkin and so many others, but there is no grape pie! I know. I'm just as upset about this unfortunate lack of development in the pie division. Think about it. Grapes are used to make jelly, jam, juice and raisins. What makes them undesirable for pie? Would they dry into raisins? Couldn't you just stick some jelly in a piecrust and bake it? It just doesn't make any sense. Another thing that bothers me is organ grinders. You know, the foreign guys with the bellhop hats and the little music thingy and the cute little monkey with the bellhop hat who collects the money? Okay. They're basically begging on the street. How did they ever afford an organ-thingy? Wouldn't it make more sense to get a kazoo, if you're broke? And if they're so poor, what possessed them to buy a monkey? I mean, I don't think I could afford a monkey, and I'm not exactly on the streets. Obviously I at least have a computer...so, back to the organ grinders. I would have sold the monkey and the organ and been able to eat for at least a year. Or, if I was weirder than I am, I could at least kill the monkey with the organ and eat it. Why on earth did they keep the monkey? It must have cost a fortune to feed...not to mention the mess. That's just one of those many facts of life that are better left mysteries. Especially since no one but me would ask the question. I better go. I think I hear a monkey...Okay...now I'm back. That's the sixth time I've said back! I realize that this longest text ever must be very boring and not worth anyone's time. But I'd like to take this time to thank the 2 and 1/2 people in the entire universe who have bothered to read this entire thing. I'm not exactly sure who they are, but: thanks! Right now, my spacebar is malfunctioning...that's not good...I have to press it two or three times just to insert a freaking space. Maybe the evil little faeries with the sharp little teeth have put their evil faerie dust on my computer. Or maybe not. This is too frustrating. Goodbye for now...Now I'm back. And still frustrated. But for a different reason. Today I had the misfortune of playing a Treasure Planet game on neopets.com It was terrible. Apparently the point of the game was to get your character to shout "Whoo-Hoo!" as many times as possible before you splattered your brains on the rocks, all the while listening to a soundtrack that is similar to a dying ceiling fan. Of course, when I started out I accidentally hit the rocks approximately three million times. Halfway though I used my four remaining brain-cells to decide that the game was dumb. So my goal changed from surviving to laughing evilly while my character died. So the game naturally did everything it could to preserve my life. The stupid game is still going on and I refuse to quit because I want my points. My character is actually dodging the stupid rocks better now then when I controlled him. I hate irony. Seeya. Okay. Now I'm back again. Today I added an update page, which is basically a less chaotic, outlined version of this without all the ranting. It's more like techno talk about arrays and how much I suck and whether or not the Braves will win this year. Okay, the whole braves thing is made up. But everything else I've said so far is true. I think. Maybe I should start on a boring disclaimer...Eh-hem. All contents of this site were designed for entertainment purposes only. Any use thereof that is not stated in the above mentioned statement would make the author, hereby referred to as Patron Saint of Paper Clips, very angry. Should you violate the purpose of this site: i.e. become not entertained, the Patron Saint of Paper Clips will be forced to take drastic measures. This is specified in Code: 343 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook. Ooooo…that’s a great idea! I’m gonna start quoting from the Flaming Chicken Handbook! Code: 343 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook states that the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (that’s me) is allowed to cause vague, pain like sensations while the offending person (or alien life form, dog, etc.) isn’t paying attention. Now I have a purpose in life! To make up quotes from the non-existent Flaming Chicken Handbook, which I’m sure you have a copy of. No? Too bad. It’s in the mail, I promise! Now I must take my leave…and remember. Cheese is watching. Okay...I'm back...I think that eventually half of this thing will consist of the word back over and over again...that's just weird. Which fits the motif of the rest of the site. There's even a money back guarantee. Isn’t' that nice? See? Now no one can ever say that I don't take care of my viewers. Especially since I don't have viewers. I have readers. Wait...I really don't even know if anyone bothers to read this. Even if I put it in a less chaotic, more user-friendly format people would still ignore this because it involves: reading. Yes. Sad to admit, but the majority of people would rather read the summary at the back of a book rather than the whole book itself. What has the world come to? It's pathetic. Especially since I'm bothering to write all this. It's not fair! Why can't I have more readers?! All the other internet writers have nothing on me, except they're better at advertising, having a central theme/plot and basically more talented. Whereas I'm more into the whole ranting and raving stage right now. Plus, I am horrible at spelling. Which is bad. Thank the powers that be for spell-check. The single greatest invention of the computer gods. I'm getting bored, so I think I'm done for the day. May your day be shiney! I'm back again! And I feel weird! I found at that yet another one of my friends is reading this. Creepy. Just how much time do they have on their hands. Perhaps their just trying to be nice. I can just see it now...an organization devoted not to feeding the hungry, or peace, or love or whatever, but to giving recognition to all those poor, pathetic, unpopular websites. I wonder what it's name would be. Don't Ignore Sites? Would it be called DIS? Isn't that like a slang term for an insult? Would that be considered poetic justice, or just a nice coincidence? And why do I even care? I'll tell you why. Because I have nothing else to do right now. I could be playing neopets, but ever since my bad experience with Treasure Planet, I don't feel like it. Oh, by the way, I noticed that whenever I use spell-check, my stupid computer turns the word probley into to word problem. To prevent this, I did nothing. So, it is now up to you, the imaginary reader, to decide whether I mean probley or problem...it's almost like a game! But without the bad sound track. And I promise not to force you to live when you would rather die. Moving on, I have nothing else to say, but don't feel like quitting just yet. I'm like the little engine that could. Or maybe the Energizer Bunny. I just keep going, and going and going. Or I could be like that annoying guy on T.V. who keeps asking if you can hear him. If my site manages to last a decade, my readers *snicker* will probley wonder what I'm talking about. My answer is simple. It doesn't matter. I'm just rambling. Which means that it doesn't matter if you understand anything I say. Doesn't that make you feel better? I bet it does. Wow. Look how long this has gotten. I even impress myself. Who would have thought I have this much free time? And I congratulate any reader who has gotten this far. Ooooooo! You must check out the fortunes section of the random stuff page! I've just gotten an idea for some more, original, fortunes...I gotta go!(may the moose be with you) And now I am back. I swear. If iI fill out the fake tab form I'm gonna have to put back as my favorite word...I already have filled it out, though. Would it be cheating to fill it out again? Only if I had multiple personalities. Or would it be cheating if I didn't have multiple personalities? The world may never know. Just like how many licks it takes to get to the bottom of a tootsie pop. Would it vary? The number of licks, I mean. Someone could have super-disolving spit, or watery-spit. Or what if you took big ol' slobbery licks? Does the commercial take that into account? No. It doesn't. And let me tell you, it's an outrage. It deludes all of American's sweet, innocent, candy-loving children into thinking that a cartoon owl is smarter than they are! "Mr. Owl, can you tell us how many licks does it take to get to the bottom of a tootsie pop?" Or whatever. And "Mr. Owl" replies "One...Twoo...Three! Chomp" And he bites it. That teaches our youth that it's okay to agree to help someone, and then ruin their experiment. Well...it's not. I am going to start a protest group. Teens Against Cartoon Owls. We could call ourselves TACO! I love the little tacos, I love them good! That is a direct quote from GIR, co-star and comic-relief on INVADER ZIM. Hmmmm...intersting. I put hyphens in both of his titles...it must be a conspiracy! I gotta go. Those TACO buttons don't make themselves, you know. I'm back again. And not so cheesed off about the whole tootsie roll pop thing. Right now, I have another twenty minutes on the Internet before I'm gonna watch T.V. And I can't think of anything else to do. So, predictably, here I am. It's not like I have anything better to do. Obviously, you know this. After all, look how long this text is. I wonder if I've made the world record? If I did, would I stop this? Why bother asking? I'll will most likely still be adding to this on my death bed. Hmmmmm...has any old, senile person ever written anything? Was it coherent? Did it make more sense that this text? Is it possible to make less sense? Am I enjoying asking retorical questions? Yes. Yes, I am. But I seriously wonder what something written by a senile person would be like. I've heard of poems and stuff written by people who were high, insane or paranoid. But never senile. Can a senile person write? Aren't they regressed to a child-like state? Does it even matter? Is anyone even reading this? Did I resume asking retorical questions? Do you care? Is this eating up time? I feel like I'm playing questions only on whose line is it anway. I probley should have capitalized something, or underlined but I'm feeling lazy...hey, you try to keep your two and a half readers happy! It's really stressfull. Someday, I'm gonna snap and just delete this entire thing. Gee, I hope not! I worked sorta hard on this. It's great for making random topics weave together to form an overall infrastructure of chaos. That made little sense. That's why it's here, and not some critically acclaimed site. Ooooooooooooo! I'm gonna quote from the FLAMING CHICKENS HANDBOOK again! Yep! I bet you were just breathless in anticipation. Okay. Here goes. Code: 472 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that this site in no way aknowledges the existance of other, better sites (hereon reffered to as the Losers) The Losers are a myth. The Patron Saint of Paper Clips (me again!) claims no knowledge as to where that particullary nasty rumor started, but confirms that this is the best site ever. It would be a sin against humanity for a better site to exist. Should you refuse to aknowledge the Patron Saint of Paper Clips as the ruler of the Internet, you will be subjected to punishment as stated in Code 343 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook (i.e. Experience vague, pain-like sensations when you're not paying attention) This has been a public service announcement. This is a test, I repeat only a test. Had this been an actual emergency, we would have bought up all the can openers and charged 3 cows and a pig for each one. I repeat, lock all you doors and windows, this is it. I repeat, there is nothing to worry about. Everything is fine. The end is not here. I'm going, you're on you're own! Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm back!*smiles brightly* And apparantly delusional! Anyway, I just finished rereading my longest text ever. And I became inspired to talk about nothing. You see, I periodically read the longest text ever to check the constant downward spiral of my sanity. Hmmm...I seem to be entertaining myself though, even while reading what I wrote. Which is why I still go to the Really Really Big Button That Doesn't Do Anything website. Because I am easily amused and have lots and lots of time on my hands. Maybe, some day far in the future (like next Thursday) I'll print a copy of this insane text. And then go door to door distributing it. Eventually, this would become a monthly tradition. Whole families would gather around their front door, in breathless anticipation while they attempted to barracade me out. I can just see the whole community rising to thwart my attempts to spread love, joy and insane chaos. I probley wouldn't actually print this out (think how much paper it would take!) but if I do, only friends and enemies will receive copies. Hmmmm...maybe my condition is worsening. Or not. I'm still peeved about the cartoon owl from the Tootsie Roll Pop commercials. He is pure evil. TACO will eventually destroy him. Unless he has already been destroyed by an even more radical Anti-Cartoon-Owl group. I hope not. Or, would that be good? I suppose I could let someone else have the glory. After all, I'm not in this line of buisness for the fame, fortune and power. What line of buisness, do you ask? Why, the assasinating annoying cartoon characters buisness. (Actually I just question them untill they spontaneously combust, I ask lots of questions) So, in conclusion, ladies and gentleman of the jury(that's you) I could not have possibly tortured "Mr. Owl" to death. I love owls. Hmm...I seem to be jumping from one subject to another more frequently. Either I am growing more comfortable with my on-line writing, or I am progressivly getting more insane and chaotic. I also am psyco-analyzing myself a lot today...hmmmm...I'm even saying "hmmmmm..." a lot. Just like a real psychologist. Hmmmmmmm. Time for another boring disclaimer!!!!!!! Code: 742 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that in no part does the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (That's still me!) actually claim to be mentally ill. That's either a) a publicity stunt b) An attempt at humor c) a cry for help or d) none of the above You can e-mail your responses by conducting a scavenger hunt of this site. Some of the pages of this site contain a link encouging the two and a half people to e-mail the Patron Saint of Paper Clips. There may also be evil little links that are designed to confuse you. These links send stuff to someone named johnjones333@hotmail.com The Patron Saint of Paper Clips does not know who this individual is, but sincerly wishes that you send all your hate mail to him. Not that the aformentioned individual claims to have received hate mail (or mail of any kind) via a website link. Thank-you for your time. Remember to send your answers to my sanity quiz to the e-mail account, flamingchickens333@hotmail.com Oh, and once I refer to myself in the first person again, the handbook quote is over. I just thought that I might like to mention that. Oh. You're still here. I figured you rush right on over to e-mail me. Perhaps you don't have time to waste e-mailing me. HA! HA! HA! That's funny!!!! If you you don't have time to waste, what are you doing here?!!! Oh, who am I kidding. I figure that even the people I manage to lure onto my site from neopets don't even bother to come to this particular page. Maybe I should make the link come here directly...Hey! What a good idea! That way I can spread my love, joy and insane chaos to more people! I'm a genius. Gotta go, must lure innocent victems to the second most pointless site ever!!!! I'm back. And really angry, and confused. I've always known that I was weird, that's always been a given. But now I realize that I am considerably more normal than the rest of my family. Today we had a "family outing." Now, most families will go bowling, or putt-putt golfing. They may go to a resteraunt with an arcarde, or the movies or to a theme park. Not my family! No, we got the greatest family outing of all. We got to go to a bar and play pool!!!!!*waits for readers to become insanely jealous* Yep, that's right, a bar with a pool table! Not only did we get world class cuisine (under-cooked hotdogs and over-cooked hamburgers), my little sister (age 10) got taught pool by someone I strongly supect is an ex-convict! Naturally when it was announced that we'd be eating dinner in this place, I could hardly contain my excitment(I glared at my mother and asked why we couldn't go to Pizza Hut) When we arrived, we were promptly served (after thirty minutes) In the meantime, we played a family game of pool(my parents played while my brother and sister and I watched) After two rousing rounds, our food came. The food was superb, (our food came the exact opposite of how we ordered it, and half of the onion rings were missing) Then we joyfully returned to our game(my sister and the ex-con played my mom) We spent hours there (from 5p.m.-7:15p.m.) There were many people that were the same age as me and my siblings (no one in the room but us were under 30) Us kids had to be dragged kicking and screaming from the bar ( I almost fell asleep during the last game I watched) As we left, there was a feeling of goodwill and fellowship between all(my sister locked me out of the car and wouldn't let me in untill I started yelling profanity in her general direction) The high point of the entire night was when my mother gave me $21 for my report card. She promptly borrowed $1 to help with the waitresses tip(This part I'm not being sarcastic about) All in all it was a night I'll remember forever (as the lowest point in "family outing"history, except for that time my mom dragged me to a church thing on the concept of truth.) My brother(age 13) even decided upon a new job he wants when he's old enough to work, a busboy at the bar. We had to tell him that he would probley have to wait untill he was 21.(Absolutly nothing about that statement was sarcastic) As you can see, I love my families outings(Not unless you're blind...or stupid) &#!#%&&!!!(*%$ WHAT THE %$#@ WAS MY MOTHER $#$#%$# THINKING!!!!!!!???? BRINGING $#$$# KIDS IN A BAR!? I know it was her idea, 'cause my dad hates it, too. My mom and my stupid little 10-year old sister loves it, though. *sighs* Why does my life have to be so weird? I'm leaving...now I'm back! And not so pissed at my weird family. Now is the time to mourn the loss of one of my most loyal readers (I think she's read the entire thing one time, which is more than anyone else has done so far) She has been banned from accesing any portion of the Internet, do to reasons that must remain confidental due to security reasons. If I told you, I'd have to kill you and all that stuff. So...now I am down to one and a half readers. Untill such time that I have more. I wonder why anyone would read this? You would have to have several characteristics that I possess. First of all, you'd have to have an extrodinary amount of free time. Second of all, you would have to have the patience to read through all of this. And lastly, you'd have to know where the heck this site is. I admit it. I haven't exactly advertised this site. Nor can I find it on any search engines. Some of my pages have stuff written in to make search engines recognize me, but it doesn't seem to be working. What must I do to rise above obscurity? I tell people I know about this site, but they either ignore this page, or don't even bother coming to the site in the first place. I suppose that is the bane of all authors. To pour your heart and soul into a passage, and have everyone ignore it. *sniffle* Why must this be? Maybe I should just give up. After all, no one would really care if I quit updating this site. But I can't help but think of stuff like the evil over lord list and REALLY REALLY BIG BUTTON THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. They are not great neccesarily because of the content, (although that helps some) they are great because of their sheer length. You can read a little each day. And almost never finish. Also, I guess I still am trying to get the world record. I have heard some feedback suggesting that I make someway for people to remember where they stopped reading. It can be very confusing, especially if you weren't paying attention in the first place. Well, I dont want to organize this page, in any manner. This is chaos. And insanity. Not neat little text in classifiable rows, in alphabetical order. If you want neat, go to some other site(though, as mentioned in Flaming Chickens Code:472 there is no such thing as a site better than this one). Otherwise, I guess you're stuck with me. Awwwww...I'm touched! You didn't run screaming to another site, thankfull for the chance to escape this insanity. You're still here, which must mean that you'd rather be here than anywhere else! Hey, where are you going?! I thought you were gonna stay here and keep me company?! *drags reader back* See, I knew you'd stay! *gagged reader glares* What's that? I know this is the best site ever, thanks for the compliment! *reader starts inching towards freedom* I better go...I think that I may have a problem brewing. I'm back. And very concerned about this new, younger generation (all 10 year olds who were born in 1992) They are supposed to be the future. Instead they appear to be a nuclear armagedon in the form of a fifth grader. I chanced to have an interview with an informant from this evil generation (my little sister) who will be called Mrs. X for security reasons (no, she's not married, the "Mrs" makes it good as a disguise) I was quizing Mrs. X on Civil War History for an upcoming test in her classroom (whose location can not be devulged) Mrs. X seemed fluent in the subject. Using prior knowledge, I deduced that Mrs. X was full of crap. Out of sheer curiosity, I asked Mrs. X who participated in the Civil War. She immediatly replied "Clara Barton". I clarified, which countries fought in the Civil War. She answered: England, Russia, and (out of sheer desperation) Iraq. I believe that she was just listing countries she knows America has fought against. Now, correct me if I'm wrong...but Iraq? I don't know if Iraq even existed in the Civil War Era! Why on earth would we go have way across the world to fight them when we didn't even really need oil?!! Moving on, I finaly managed to coax my sister (I'm tired of writing Mrs. X) to tentativly guess that America fought in the Civil War. I mean, who'd a thought? America? Fighting in the American Civil War? In a moment of inspiration, I asked her who America fought. Her first guess was enslaved africans. Well, at least she knows that slaves were involved in the war. Before she could start listing all of America's enemies, I gave her a hint. I said "The Union fought..." With a crack, snaple and pop, some random synapses in her brain connected in the right order and she said "CONFEDERACY!!!" I was very proud of her, just as you would be proud of a two-year-old who has just announced: "I WENT POO-POO ON THE POTTY!!!!!" What I mean is, you wouldn't be very proud if the average person said that they just took a dookey on the toilet, and you wouldn't be very proud if they knew who fought against the Union in the Civil War. I confirmed that the Union was Northern and Free, and that the Confederacy was Southern and Slave. We resumed quizzing and she got every question on the worksheet correct. This is because she memorizes the questions. That way, she can pass the test without actually learning anything. You see, if you memorize stuff, you only have to remember that the answer to number 6 is Clara Barton for a week, rather than having to remember that Clara Barton started the Red Cross for the rest of you life. I sincerely appologize if anyone is offended by my view of memorization. I also would like such persons to immediatly leave my site. You don't belong here. You see...knowledge is good. If my sister...uh...Mrs. X were ever asked a question on the Civil War on a quiz show, she'd come up with nothing. With knowledge you can win money and the opportunity to look like a dork on national television. My sister is a big believer in the memorization system. I previous time when I was studying with her (American Revolution, this time) I was trying to help her remember the difference between the Patriots(Patriotic to America) and the Loyalists (Loyal to Britain) She didn't know what the word patriotic meant. I tried to explain. I asked her how you dress on the forth of july (she said nice) I asked what the colors red, white and blue were (pretty). I gave up in exasperation. More recently, I was trying to instill a sense of empathy and niceness in her. I asked her what the golden rule of christianity was. She didn't know. When I pressed her, she confessed she didn't know what chrisianity was. Completly defeated, I told her that it was the religion she practiced every Sunday when she went with her friends to church. This confirmed my suspicion that she only went so that she could have the use of the church's playground equipment. My family also strongly suspects that she stole $20 from the donation thingy. Anyway, that's my rant on the new generation that contains my little sister. When someone of her generation runs for president, I'm gonna do a complete background check. If they're anything like my sister, I'm movin' to Canada. Gotta go...the Russian-Brittish-Iraqi-enslaved-Africans are coming to defeat the Mexicans. I'm back! *there's that darn cricket again* And I have a genuine question to ask all of my loyal readers *cough-cough* Okay, here it is: Is it normal for a non-gender specific sibling to carry around various dead reptiles (snakes, turtles, lizards etc.) Furthormore, is it considered accepted behavior to talk to these dead reptiles, in a cooey, baby talky kind of voice? Finnaly, is it expected for said sibling's non-gender specific parent to encourage such behavior, citing "I was just like that as a child" as an excuse? It's an honest question as I fear that my non-gender specific sibling is weird. Who am I kidding? My entire family is weird. It's just a matter of degree. Hey, by the way. I'm sorry that my last few entries have been only about my various family antics. Although I can't see why you care, because there is a large probability that you do not exist, because I don't think anyone is reading this anymore. How discouraging. People need to make the time to waste time. It's a time honored tradition. Who'd thought that I could use time that many times in only a few sentences? It's been pretty quiet here lately, which is why I haven't added anything to this text in awhile. I know, you were just crushed that nothing new was happening. It's a sad, cold, cruel world out there and you had nothing to relieve the monotony of it. *sniffle* I feel so sorry for you! Next thing you know, you're internet connection will die. Well, too bad! Do you know I never even had a computer untill just a few months ago (that's why I'm obsessivly writing here) So I won't pity you if you're computer dies for unexpected reasons. Time for another quote from the FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK!!! Code: 843 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook states that in no way is the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (guess who?) responsible for any faulty wiring or lack thereof in your computer. The Patron Saint of Paper Clips in no way wishes harm on your computer. Any derogatory statement is simply an opinion of an individual, not of the flaming order of the flaming chickens. Said order will in no way be held responsible for any damages, injuries, loss of life, limb, head, or organs. Okay, quote is done. Maybe I should put quotation marks around them...nah, too much work. But I probably will eventually get around to having a seperate page just for the FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK. That way all the members (what members) can print out a copy of it for themselves (if they didn't get that copy in the mail) I guess I'm done for the day...I know. You want me to stay. It's okay. Because eventually, I'll be back! Seeya! I'm back. And once again suprised. When I was at a TAB poetry thingy (TAB is good TAB is great We love TAB) I met some new people. One of these people (who shall remain nameless untill such time that I have explicit permission to use her name) turned out to be almost as weird as me. As in...she read the ENTIRE Longest Text Ever. The whole thing. So far two whole people (to my knowledge) have read the entire thing, and a few people have skimmed it. That means I really can justify claiming to have two and a half readers! I'm so happy! That means my pointless obsession has actually entertained someone besides me! Perhaps, one day, far in the future, this will actually be a world record and random people will acutally voluntarily read this text every day. Or maybe not. The point is that it is nice to have readers. Or maybe it's not...I mean...won't the quality *snicker* of my work deteriorate if I am no longer writing for the target audience of me? If that happens, then no one will read this. And then I'll be writing for me again. And then the quality will rise. And then people will start reading. And then the quality will go down and the vicious spiral of good and bad will continue untill I either give up this text, or go crazy...er. In any case...I should probably find a topic. Yeah...a topic would be good. Or...I could just continue to write about finding a topic. Ooooo! I know a topic! Ice cream trucks! This has been bothering me for a while. You see...when it's hot, you want something cold to eat. Conviently, ice cream trucks come around during the hottest part of the year (it must be a conspiracy). As you may or may not know, small children swarm the ice cream trucks. The vendors even play whimsical music which I strongly suspect contains subliminal messages to make you hungry for ice cream. The vendors get oodles of cash, and the kids get ice cream. Now, in today's society of buying groceries on-line and getting them delivered, why hasn't any other food industry marketed this ingenius idea to bring the product to the consumer. I can just see Hot Dog, and Pizza trucks roaming the neighbor hoods, selling treats to hungry children...and adults. Of course, said adults would have to peel their butt-cheeks off the couch...but they'd have to do that for the delivary man anyway. The food trucks could even play music that made you hungry for their food. Then the problem with obesity in America would be blamed on evil food truck drivers as opposed to the harmless, benificient television and computer. We could all breath a sigh of relief as parents kept their children inside, away from the evil truck drivers and near the T.V. Gone would be the days when parents told children to play outside, it's a nice day. Parents would buy their children computers, video games and other television neccesities. This, of course would expand the market for such products. This would lead to a better, more stable economy. Food industires would be buying cars, gas and music. Parents would increase the purchase of entertainment items. In return companies would make a profit, pay their workers better. The workers would then be able to afford more entertainment items and the upward spiral would continue, as opposed to the evil downward spiral of my writing. In conclusion, Ladies and Gentlemen...if you implement my idea, there will be peace and prosperity for all. As long as you don't mind a few more couch potatoes. Gotta go...I think I hear a catchy jingle. I'm back...it's been awhile since I've written here. A lot has happened. Like my EVIL school computer deleting my updates page. But it's all good. Especially since I just saw The Matrix: Reloaded. The following text may spoil the movie for you, so WARNING: do no read this unless you have already seen the movie. Okay. What I liked best was the philosophy on choices. (the mindless fight scenes were really cool, too). It's like this. In the beginning of the movie, Neo is having dreams about Trinity's death. Later, The Oracle tells him that he has already decided her fate. Towards the end of the movie, Neo chooses to tell Trinity to stay out of the Matrix, since he saw her die in it. She agrees, but only after seeing how important it is to him. After a horrific chain of events (is it coincidence, or fate) the people who will deactivate the secondary power source of the building Neo is infiltrating, die. So...the plan is going to fail. Unless someone does something, Neo, Morpheus and many others will die. Trinity, who is of course outside of the Matrix, knows this and chooses to enter the Matrix to save the day. The events of Neo's dream unfold. So...when the oracle said that the choice had already been made, she was completely correct. The moment Neo woke from dreams of Trinity's death, he made a choice. He would do everything in his power to keep his dream from becoming reality. So he kept her out of the Matrix, and she saw the problem, and entered the Matrix to fix it. If she had been in the Matrix, she would have likely been with Morpheus, never would have known about the plan's failure, would therefore not have been in the situation that resulted in her death. And the plan would have failed and Neo might have died, along with a large portion of the city (the building was set to blow if there was any intruders) So...Neo's choice to attempt to save Trinity triggered the sequence of events that led to her death. As Neo realizes all of this, through a nearly omniscient Architect of the Matrix, he makes another choice. This choice is simply an extension of his original choice: he will save Trinity at all costs. Neo is told that he has two choices. He can save mankind, and doom Trinity. Or he can try to save Trinity and doom mankind. No guarantee that he'll succeed in saving Trinity. He goes for Trinity, makes it just in time to catch her body, and starts her heart back up. In return for not taking the easy route, he gains a power in the more or less real world. He can deactivate the machines, (squidies) but at great personal cost. The movie ends with him in a coma. Now, you must realize that I have described only one aspect of this movie of all movies. There are not enough words in the English language to describe the sheer coolness of the fight choreography, special effects and the plot. I highly recommend you see the movie yourself. I'm sorry that today's rant isn't random, insane or completely chaotic, but I must right my experience with The Matrix before I forget. I am so buying this movie when it comes out on DVD. I love it! You have to admit its sheer coolness. I mean, come on! It's the sequel to the movie that revolutionized the standard by which we judge special effects. I better stop typing before I have a heart attack...just remember...The Matrix has you...I'm back. And throughly pissed off at my school system in general. You see...they feel that the only way to reward academic achievement...yada-yada-yada...is to force the smart kids to be ushers for Senior Honor Nite, and Graduation. Where is the logic in this? I for one, didn't know about such dire consequences for not deliberatly failing classes. It was bad enough that I was forced to "volunteer" my precious time (i could have worked on this site)...no...I was forced to wear formal attire. My school system is stuck in the past...and formal attire means...a dress...a white dress...(for those you who never bothered to find out...I am indeed female). So...for the first time in about 5 years...I wore a dress...and something that was complelty white. What cruel fate is this? To compound the EVIL situation...I was forced to wear feminine shoes. In other words...they hurt. And they pushed my toes together. Since I have a rather weird phobia of touching my own skin...this made my evening my own personall torture session. I think that such gender-specific torture should be deemed inhumane and abolished from our great society...of flaming chickens. Henceforth...Code: 666 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that under no circumstance will the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (guess who) be forced to wear anything other than a t-shirt and preferably black jeans. Should you violate this right, you will become destroyed or possibly dizzy. I'm leaving now...I have some destruction to do. i'm back. from graduation. we had to get there one hour and fifteen minutes early because there was traffic. After standing around a lot...the ceremony started. Lots of people spoke. by the time I had to do my part (tell people where to stand before getting their diploma) it was dark. there were bugs. they liked landing on me. then...i got to go stand while people said a lot of stuff. i couldn't hear it because someone had put the speakers facing the audience. we clapped. the whole time, even during the name-calling, seniors were playing with silly string and beachballs. afterwards...they turned off the lights. there were lots of fireworks. i wandered around for 20 minutes looking for a cell phone. i called home, and waited another hour for my ride...traffic to the school was one way. i felt sorry for my dad. i am tired...but cannot go to sleep. i'll copy and paste this to my site. maybe the longest text ever. you will all suffer as i have suffered when and if you graduate. i cannot feel my feet. i hate dress shoes. I'm back. Today, I'm here to salute the Pointless Signs Of America! The PSOA have been whole-heartedly working for you, and what have you done for them? NOTHING! These so-called "pointless" signs are doing just what they were meant to do: entertain you! You cannot judge them simply because they have no apparant function. They expand your mind, making you think about all the things they could do. They could do anything they wanted to, if they just put their minds to it. If you judged everything by what it doesn't acomplish, then the entire world is populated by pointless beings. Noone can do everything, so how can you expect a SIGN, with the I.Q. of toilet paper, to do everything. You people sicken me. You expect far to much of the inanimate world. The inanimate world, on the otherhand, expects nothing of you. Which is exactly what it gets. If you expect nothing, and get nothing, you feel nothing. If you expect nothing and get something, you're happy. But, if you expect something and get something you feel nothing. And if you expect something and get nothing, you feel cheated. If you're following along, and not completly confused, you'll realize that it is better to be a pessimist than an optomist. Yep that's right. This entry went from saluting the PSOA to making a statement about my ideals. This has been a weird day. You can thank my associate "Meg" she came up with the PSOA acronym. Everyone, clap for "Meg".I gotta go...seeya later! I'm finnaly back! Today, I took a long look at this site, which is the acomplishment of almost a year of work. And I asked myself "How could I have better spent my time?" And so, in the interest of wasting even more time, I made a list. Here we go! Number One: I could have cured cancer. Not that I know anything about medicine...or cancer for that matter. But I'm sure that if I just would have put my mind to it, I could have done it. Number Two: I could helped the earth to find eternal and lasting peace. Which would be boring. So I at least have an excuse for not doing that. Number Three: I could have studied and stuff. Uh...don't think so...Number Four: I could have learned to drive. This would have resulted in the deaths of numerous pedistrians...and I would still probably be wondering around in search of a McDonalds. Number Five: I could have read more books, played more video games and watched more mindless television. Gee...I wish I'd thought of that sooner. Number Six: I could have implemented one of several plans for world domination. Or, as an alternative, I could have ruined several plans for world domination that other people made. Number Seven: I could drive people crazy. Wait...aren't I already doing that? Scratch number seven. And on to: Number Eight: I could have...uhhhh...ummmmm...actually thought up these things before hand. Number Nine: Now it's just getting redundant, isn't it? Number Ten: This is the list that never ends. Yes, it goes on and on my friend. One person, started typing it not knowing what it was, and they'll continue typing it forever just because this is the list that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friends, some person started typing it not...etc, etc. Okay...I admit it. I have officialy run out of ways I could have better spent my time. I don't think there actually are any. Except for maybe five and six. Now, those have possibilities. However, I am currently content to just sit here and type. For the benefit of you, the reader...who may or may not exist. Either way, I'm continuing to sort of entertain myself. I feel like I should be outraged about some topic or another. I just can't work up the energy to be outraged. Perhaps a nice, soothing mistrust. Yeah. I can work with mistrust. I definitly mistrust lots of stuff. Like organ grinders, and the evil conspiracies. Did you know, that Kodak was part of the conspiracy to assasinate John F. Kennedy. Now, some of you are probably thinking "Gee, Really?", or "Wow, I never knew that!" while others are thinking "Who's John F. Kennedy?" or possibly "Who or What is Kodak". I fervently hope that you're not thinking the last two...especially about Kodak. Kodak, as you may know, is a film developing company. And John F. Kennedy (JFK) was an alien bent on global domination. Or possibly a really good president who wanted to fly to the moon. Either way, he got assasinated. And ever loony in America decided that it was a conspiracy. Some even go so far as to claim that Kodak "changed" the pictures of the assasination to make an assasination in the bushes become a tree's shadow. I didn't know that they had such good technology back then. I have to wonder...why would Kodak do such a thing. Perhaps Kodak is actually a front organization for a shadowy governmental system that controls the entire world and didn't want mankind to obtain the freedom of the stars and so tried to sabotauge the space program even though it didn't work as well as they planned. Or perhaps not. Either way, Kodak is undeniably evil. How can any company that takes so many "wholesome" pictures not be? You can just bet that they look at every one that get's turned in to them, judging blackmail value, and whether or not you could get arrested. It's just sickening, you can't even take a simple photo nowadays. Unless you have a digital camera, which are a symbol of freedom from the old ways and willing enslavement to the new ways. We can only hope that the digital camera manufacturers are kinder masters than the evil Kodak Lords. I better go...I think Kodak is tracing my site....I'm back now! And, once again, I have proof that someone actually took the time (two hours) to read this entire Longest Text Ever! It's amazing, it's incredible, it's unbelievable. But true. Even more incredible, this time it's someone I don't even know! Wooooooo! I feel inspired and happy and other really good emotions and stuff. And so, I'll take a trip down memory lane, to the dark depths of the past, to when I decided to make this page. It was inspired, in part, by my sheer and utter boredom. In school, back before I even owned a computer, I'd type random words for long periods of time, 'cause I had nothing better to do. Once I got this computer, I decided to do something similar on my beloved site. But, it ended up making more sense than I anticipated (scary thought, huh). Oh, well...I tired of nostalgia. Back to the present. Right now, I'm just typing so that no one can say that I've been slacking off. I don't think I have any conspiracy theories...except pop-ups/pop-unders. Have you ever had the evil pop-up that says that if you click here, it'll get rid off all the annoying pop-ups? Isn't that sort of ironic? Could the pop-up blocker people have chosen a better means to advertise their product? It's like grand-theft auto 3's talk show, you know, the one where there are Citizens Raging Against Phones? Or CRAP, for short. And the lady representing them, calls the radio station...on a phone. It's stupid and ironic and just shouldn't exist in a better world. Pop-Up ad's help you get rid of pop-up ads? Insane, chaotic...hmmmmm...I wonder who thought of it? Was it on purpose, or was it just some mistake? It is now my civic duty to discover this ancient mystery, and reveal it to the uncaring world. Or maybe I'll go make a frozen pizza. Yeah. That sounds good, too. Since I'm not particualarly inspired at the moment, I should leave and let you gather what is left of your sanity. I just can't seem to stop, though. Okay...I can do it. I'm leaving. I'm back...and it's several hours later. I've decided to imortalize the stupidity of my dog, Moose. She is a heavy-set Yorkshire Terrior (12 lbs.) In otherwords, she's a small yappy dog who is big for her breed. Today, I met her arch-enemy. An enemy so terrifying that Moose cannot stop shaking. An enemy so hideous that Moose must destroy it at all costs. An enemy so dangerous that Moose fears it above all others. Now you may be wondering what horrible beast is Moose's arch-enemy. And you probably suspect that it is something pathetic. You would be correct in your suspiciousness...for Mooses arch-enemy is...*dramatic drumroll*...a small, white, feather. Now, Moose has seen many feathers, birds even. But none have struck terror in her little moose heart like this particular feather. So...naturally I put her arch-enemy in my pocket and brought it home with me. This action has made her very suspicious of where my loyalties lie. She tracks the feather smell all over the house, and goes crazy whenever I take it out of my pocket. She even got her sister and mother in the spirt of things. Now her sister sounds an alarm whenever she sees the evil feather. Now, you may be wondering what is so terrifying about a small, white, feather. So am I. It doesn't smell funny, (I asked my brother, since I don't have a sense of smell), it seems perfectly ordinary. So, I've decided that Moose works for some secret government organization, and that the feather is the key to the destruction of the world, and I am just blithely letting it enter our home, so that it may furthur its evil plans to destroy the universe. That is the only possible explanation as to why it upsets her so much. Or...maybe it's the feather off of the cartoon owl from the tootsie-roll pop comercials (one...two...three..*crunch*). Whatever the case, I decided that the whole world, (or three of four random people) deserve to know that if the world and or universe are destroyed, it's the evil, little, white, feather's fault. Now I'd better go and torture my Moose with it...:) I am officially back. And you, the potentially non-existant reader gets a once in a lifetime chance to hear me rant and rave about my Horrible, Horrible Family Vacation. I know. You feel very, very honored. It's like this. My mother is a control freak, and she decided on the spur of the moment that we were going north to visit relatives. Later that day, she decided we were NOT going north, we were going south to a beach resort. Still later that day, she got offended at some trivial thing and decided that we weren't going anywhere at all. The very next day, she decided that we were going north, after all. So, we packed everthing up. Before we knew it, we were on the road. The first part of the trip was fairly easy. As in, I was half-asleep, hoping that we'd arrive while I slept. Then, in an inspired move, my brother talked my mother into letting him sit up front. That meant that my mother would be in the back, with me and my younger, eviler sister. Immediatly, my mother started complaining. It was uncomfortable in the back, it was too hot, it was too cold. Then, she accidently woke our three yappy dogs up, and they relized that they were in a car. That meant only one corse of action for them. They started shaking and barked their little heads off. This annoyed my mother further, untill she asked, no, demanded that my father turn the car around so that we could go home. Unfortuantly, we had already driven 337 miles toward our destination. After much argument, my father was going to turn around, untill he realized that my mother was going to drop the dogs and me off, and then turn around and continue north. This seemed slightly unpracticle, so we ended up not taking that 337 mile detour. We eventually reached our destination after 16 hours of virtually non-stop driving. We got there, we ate. We slept. My mother visited relatives. And so the week went by. I got to go to a huge library, and see Terminator 3 at the local theater. That was the high point of the entire trip. The last day, we were deciding where to eat. My mom said that she didn't care. So my dad picked a steak place. My mother tried to order a mushroom-swiss burger...only to discover that the place had no swiss-cheese. So she decided on a salad, only to discover that they didn't have her favorite salad dressing. After much deliberation, she decided that she wouldn't eat. After complaining how hungry she was, and about the poor quality of the resteraunt, she walked out of the resteraunt, instructing the rest of us to "enjoy our meals". And I wonder where my little sister gets her annoyingness. Not that my mother is annoying...just set in her ways. The whole meal thing was about the only interesting thing to happen during the week. On the way home, we had gotten approximatly 4 hours into the trip when my mother predicatably decided that we had to go back and eat at the 50th aniversary of her favorite ice cream place. Needless to say, we ignored her. Oh, and when my sister had to go to the bathroom very badly during a traffic jam, my mother had the good taste to making hissing/water noises to make my sister's problem worse. She claimed that my little sister always did it to her, and she was getting pay-back. Between her bickering with my sister, and obsessivly playing neopets games, I don't know what to do with her. Anyway...that was my family vacation rant. It sucked. No suprise. At least it's over. Sorry if I complained a lot. If you don't like it, start your own longest text ever. Anyway, I promise to go back to my usual routine the next time I rant here. I thought of a topic on the way home, but forgot it. Seeya. I'm back! I know, I took you completly by suprise. You thought you'd gotten rid of me. *cheesy super-hero voice* Well, fear not, random citizen, for I, PSOPC am here! *normal voice* Today I have a very important to discuss with you in this: PERFECTLY NORMAL PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCMENT. Yes, that's right. It's time to warn you, the viewer...er...reader...about the evils of various stuff. Today's lesson is: subliminal messages . That's right, folks, mass hypnosis via commercials. Now, I'm sure you've at least heard of subliminal messages , right? No? Well...prepare to be enlightened. Subliminal messages are an advertising technique that puts hidden pictures and words into a main image. You don't see them, but your subconsious (dreaming) mind does. Your subconsious mind acts on whatever it is told. What does this mean to you? It means that WAL-MART TV IS EVIL! EVIIIIIIIIIIIIL!!!!!! Why else would they invest all that money to show commercials in their own store? Because they put subliminal messages in them, of course! Subliminal messanging also explains the successes of certain fast-food resteraunts, and brand name items. BEWARE YOUR TOASTER OVEN! Okay. That had nothing to do whatsoever with subliminal messages...it's just cool to say. Anyway, only watch wal-mart if you WANT to be subliminaly entertained into purchasing a new set of TUPERWARE, even though your old set is PERFECTLY fine. This has been a public service announcment. Pretty cool, huh? Uh...you don't have to take the subliminal stuff seriously. It's true, and all, but I have no proof about wal-mart, or certain fast food resteraunts. It makes sense, though. Wal-mart TV is evil. You cannot deny it. Seeya...hmmm..I wonder if there's subliminal stuff in my computer...I'm back. And I feel that it's time for a FAKE commercial break, for the highly informed, obviously brain-dead consumer. And now, a word from our non-existant sponsor. Ketchup: The only food that you'll want to eat after traveling to the 5th Dimension. It's been practically proven that Ketchup transforms into a highly intoxicating (non-addictive) delicious substance upon returning from the 5th Dimension. Stock up now with our Valu-Pak to recieve 3-metric tons of Ketchup, all for the low, low price of your brain, since you're obviously not using it anyway. Then, just wait for technology to "catch-up" (get it, catch-up, Ketchup?)so you can travel to the 5th Dimension like our scientists almost did. (Next Commercial) Get ready fo: Faux's new "reality" TV show, "How Low Can We Go?" It's about six contestants who compete to create the worst, least likely "reality" TV show.

How do you stop them? With our patented "spray". Our "spray" kills over 99.9% of "faeries" (which are much to small to see) Our "spray" also kills most disease causing agents, like rats, or pigeons. WARNING: Leave food sit in an open, well-venilated spot for a week before eating. And now, back to our featured presentation. Wasn't that semi-entertaining? I bet you wanna go eat some Ketchup covered Dum-B Gon right now, while watching "reality" TV. Just make sure you "spray" your food first. Pathetic, wasn't it? Oh, well. I was bored, and a dilligent reader suggested I make fake commercials, so...therer they are. Happy? Good. I'm leavin', for now. I'm back. And I'm willing to enlighten you, the potentially you-know-what reader. Today, I was checking out some weird news. At one point, I read an article that stated that it had been proven, conclusivly, that Kansas was flatter than the standard pancake. The researches even used highly advanced technololgy to map the surface of a pancake and compare it to documented geology of Kansas. Some people disagree, the director of the Kansas Geological Survey said "I think this is part of a vast breakfast food conspiracy to denigrate Kansas. It's a cheap shot." So...doesn't that make you want to take Kansas' side (I sincerly appologize if you are from Kansas). It just seems extremly weird (and worthy of mentioning) that this semi-important guy from Kansas believes in a "vast breakfast food conspiracy". Makes you think that the long held belief that Kodak conspired with the JFK assasin(s) is normal. Another article claims that an anitseptic turned a polar bear purple, drawing large crowds of people. I sure hope other zoos won't copy them. Before you know it, we'll have orange alligators, pink tigers and blue lions. School children won't be able to correctly identify the color of a zebra. Random people will think they've gone crazy, after a seemingly innocent visit to the zoo. It's wrong, I tell you. A complete and total degregation of our societies values. What values, you say? The basic moral belief that Polar bears should be WHITE. Unless we spray-painted the snow purple, too. Then it would be okay. As long as the bear blends in, you know? Speaking of animals, there's a cat in California who is a kleptomaniac (likes to steal stuff). He sneaks into neighboring homes, and takes clothing, wrapped christmas presents, and anything he can find. He then leaves them under his owners car. Okay, better leave. I'm back. And I don't really have a topic today. I'm just bored. Sometimes I just do this, you know? Start typing without any idea about what it is I intend to say. Maybe I subconsiously DO know what I'm doing here, but refuse to admit it to myself. Or maybe I am monumentally bored and don't have anything else to do at the moment. Either way, I'm here. You must be pretty bored, too. Otherwise, why on earth (beta, krpto, zkdjf, Planet X, whatever) would you be here? It would make no sense. If you have something better to do, why wouldn't you be doing it right now? I would be. But, maybe that's just the difference between you and me. Yeah. That must be it. Unless you're bored. Then I completly understand. I need to find a topic. Here, topic, topic, topic! Come on, I won't hurt you, I promise! *hides large ax behind back* Come here, topic! Why are you afraid of little ol' me? *sigh* There are no topics anywhere near me. Kinda like me and "Meg" webcomic we are trying to do. It's called Hit-Or-Miss, any topics, plot, etc. are completly accidental and are not the fault/responsibility of the creators. That was sort of a topic, even though it was sort of random. Which is what I do best. Okay, I'm done with that litte commercial. What now...hmmmmm...should I share with you more of my paranoid/delusional conspiracy theories? Or have I been doing that too much lately? Oooooo! I know, I'll start of list of why it's fun/good to be insane/weird! #1You can say or do anything and normal people will agree with you in the hopes that you'll be satisfied, shut up, and go away. Far away. I will show you an example with this completly true stuff that I experienced several years ago. ME: My vicious, psychotic, flesh-eating bunny-rabbit wants to rule the world. RANDOM PERSON: Uh-huh, that's nice. ME: Yeah, but I told her that she'd be a terible ruler. I mean, she traded Asia for a carrot! And she doesn't even LIKE carrots! RANDOM PERSON: You don't say? ME: Yep. She also is the goddess of red jello. RANDOM PERSON: *head explouding from sheer insanity* As you can see, I was a very weird child (this happened in elementary school...uh...except for that head-explouding part). Okay...on to: #2 You can get out of practically anything by saying: a)It's against my religion b)I'm allergic to that. c)I have an extremly irrational fear of that. d)I already did that in a past life and it sucked. e)My psychotic bunny predicted I'd die doing it. Unfortunalty, several of those reasons LEGITAMITLY apply to a certain activity I do every Tuesday, which WILL NOT BE NAMED HERE LEST I GIVE IT POWER OVER ME! I'm allergic to parts of it, have irrational fears about others and I'm pretty sure it's against my Jenny religion...along with eating mashed potatoes, or potatoes of any kind. I'll add that to the FLAMING CHICKENS HANDBOOK. Thou shalt not eat spuds. Hmmmm...time for #3You can obsessive over ANYTHING, and people will think nothing of it. I, personally, am obsessed with, kitties, bunnies, bats, this website, drawing, making intriate little patterns with strings, doing mildly repetitive activities, being weird, apparantly making lists and cheese...and chickens...and flame. Fire is good. Fire is free. Fire is my friend...until it burns me. Then it must die...painfully. And on to:#4You make your friends look normal in comparison. And #5: You can give each of your pets several weird names such as: Ringling-Raison-Bailey-Suzana-Midnight-Schultz, Squirell, Moose, Moose-Moose, Moosey-Moose, Linzey-Moose, Muffin, Squirell-Muffin, Yabby-Doodle, Abby Normal, Wiggle-Baby, Wiggle-Muffin, Witle-Baby, Cheese-Monkey, Muffin-With-Squirell-Juice, Squirell-With-Muffin Juice, Moosey-Juice, Squirell-Monkey, etc. Now, wasn't that a fun list!? Doesn't that just make you proud to be weird? I should make bumber stickers saying that. Proud to be weird. It'd be cool. Anyway, gotta go! *yawn* I'm back. Last night I was super-charged with lots of sugar and not a lot of sleep. I ended up writing things during the time of night when EVERYTHING is hilarious, including the word sheep. To compound things, I wasn't alone, and things just escalated. The following is everything I wrote during that sugar-coated time period. Some are answers to e-mails, the rest are just stuff I wrote.

Definitly. THen we go to library. Guess what? Me and Josh ate lots and lots of sugar, and it's late at nite and everything is funny but we can't laugh 'cause everybody is sleepin' so it's even funnier but ever since we drank the water we sobered up even though we weren't drunk but we ate sugar...lots and lots of sugar. MOstly donut cake. Okay. JOsh says it was only one piece of cake. WE got it at Wal-mart. Or his mom did. OR something. Goodbye...oh, and the fresh chicken wings might be to blame. they were special wings. I hope I remember doing this. I think it's pretty funny. > You have blue hari..*gigles* I like hair. Josh says I probably won't remember writing any of this, but I can't sleep. THe cake was good. aSk anybody. Big Brother may be listening right now so I beter go. They're listening for a secrret...no it's cause of a secret. But the secret doesn't exist so they are stupid. *g8ggles* bye. Yes. Megan has hair. I've seen it. *giggling* It's very, very late at nite. ONly not really. i like sugar. NO, wait. It's early. WE have been having very profound thoughts lately. We think. THey might havve been important, but we keep forgetting them. We're not sure. Josh wants his thought back. *sniffle* i do, too. It's not fair. I think mine involved a jaunty song to sing. But I couldn't have sung it 'cause it would have woken everyone up and they would have called me inconsiderate. I have to get up really early to leave for home. I should be asleep. *gigles* It milght have been a sugar rush 'cause now we're having a sugar crash. OR, maybe it's the writing. Okay, maybe it was the ranch dressing instead of the special, fresh buffalo wings. But they really were'nt buffoal wings 'cause buffalo's don't have wings...cause they come off when they are babies, JOsh says so and he must be right causse he's been having Profound Thoughts even though he cannot remember them. But, the wings were'nt really special. I don't think. Maybe we're just really, really tired and had sugar. I don't want to play the stupid animal war card game 'cause the stupdi bear gets eaten by an eaagle.. ...goodbye ssslllee0yyyyslllllllleeeeeeeepppppppppppppyyyyyyyyyyy iiiiiiiiissssssssssssss gggggggggoooooooooooooddddddddddddd.............

As you can see, I was in a very interesting state of mind. I hadn't had a genuine sugar rush since I was 11. It was fairly fun. Although I acted like an idiot. Oh, well. I have more stuff to write, but I gotta go right now. Stay tuned to hear my thoughts on tanning, and an evil card game, and who knows what else...Okay I'm back. Here's what I wrote this weekend: Woooooo! 5000 hits! Aren't I special? *sigh* I can't think of anything to write. But I must. I must defeat the sister site of the Longest Text Ever! I mean, I've been doing this much, much longer than the other person. Hmmmmm...monkey. Why do weird people (myself included) obsess about monkeys? And, are monkeys spelled monkies? It just looks weird. Like a division of mounties made entirely out of monks. I bet it's spelled monkeys. It looks right. Maybe I should use spell-check. But...that'd be a lot of work, unlike ranting, raving and rambling. Hey, it's the 3 r's! No longer does school teach use reading, riting and 'rithmitic, it now teaches us ranting, raving and rambling! (and redundancy!) After all, isn't that basicly what the best teachers do? It sets a perfect example for you young, impressionable minds. Those are the best kind. *yet another highly dramatic, time-consuming sigh* I need a topic. A good one. Not one of those bargain ones anyone can find at your local topic discount outlet store. I'll rant and rave and ramble about the EVILS of sunlight. Most people actually like to spend long periods of time exposing their vulnerable skin to the harmful rays of the sun. These people have obviously suffered major brain damage from their prolonged exposure to the sun. The actually think that their skin's efforts to protect them are ATTRACTIVE. It'd be like someone thinking that scabs are atractive, 'case they protect you from disease. Then everyone would cut and scrape themselves to be covered in scabs. That's exactly what tanning is like. Purposly damaging the skin so you can look "attractive". Now, a long time ago, people were sort of smarter. They avoided the sun at all costs. They associated tans with hard, manuel labor. Then, some fasion bimbo went on a fasionable safarii to get some fasionable furs, or whatever. When she came back, 'lo and behold, she had a tan. This resourceful young vanguard of fasion decided to cover her extreme embarassment by acting like she meant to horribly damage herself. And because she was the head fasion bimbo, everyone agreed that the look was definitly "in". So, everyone went to the beach and got tans. Girls began wearing skimpier, and skimpier bathing suits. Men, of course, had no complaints. (Though whether it was the tan or the skimpy suits, no one will ever know.) As you read this Historicly Accurate Anecdote, you must realize the parallel between it and the fable The Emperoro's New Clothes. Someone did something incredbly stupid, but because they were powerful, everone acted like it was a stroke of genius. And the preceding generations became brain-washed (possibly through subliminal messages in sun-tan lotion commercials) to believe tans were expected. Those few who actually could think and avoided the sun were considered to be outcasts. I don't mean to insult you if you DO have a tan. I am simply explaining why I, personally, refuse to swim, go to the beach, sunbathe, leave the house, etc. Alrighty then. I'm gonna quit for now. I'm back. I'm so very, very tired. School has been on for four days now. I have three very hard academic classes. They give lots and lots of homework. Two and a half hours of homework (total) to be precise. I get home from work at 5:30p.m. and eat dinner. Then I do my homework. I get done at 9:15. Then I wait for my mom and dad to stop playing Collapse II so that I can get on. I usually have less than 30 minutes. It sucks. I can't really work on this site even though I now have a more in depth understanding of variables. I learned this from my calculator. I made a virtual pet for it. It was fun. I'm tired. Did I mention that, yet. My calculator is nifty. Sometimes, it is lazy. It tells me stuff like: "Warning: More Solutions May Exist" and "Questionable Accuracy". So...it doesn't bother to find all solutions, and it may be wrong. Geee....that is comforting. I love my calculator, though. It does all my Math for me. I hate Math. Math is so picky. In English, and stuff, if you miss one little detail, at most you lose partial credit, but you usually get it all right. In Math, one teeny, tiny little mistake will make you get the entire thing wrong. I tend to make those tiny mistakes, and get bad grades, even if I understand the concepts. I hate Math. I'm tired. Are you tired. I sure am. Guess what I wanna do. How did you ever guess? That's right, I wanna sleep. Why can't I? Hmmmm...good question. I think I'm so tired I can't sleep. Plus...I gots oblimagations...obligaton....obligations to this site. yeah. thats it...i so tired...bye-bye. I'm back. And more than slightly embarassed. Today my frazzled-brain produced something that is decidedly Jenny (that's my more or less "real" name). I was contemplating how my heavy load of books made me like a bulldozer and than I was about to suggest to my friend, "Meg" that we invent one. Then I realized that the buldozer already HAD been invented. That's how I knew it's name, picture and what it did. That is just...pathetic. School is taking its toll. *sigh* *sniffle* *snort* *insert word that is a sound that begins with an "s" here* I don't have much time, so, I must be brief. I'm not sure how I CAN be brief since I have absolutly nothing to say. The best way to be brief is to quit now. Right now. Which is what I'm about to do. Any miniute now. I promise. Okay. Bye! *sigh* My dogs are just weird. You remember my Moose's arch-enemy, don't you? You know, the small, white feather. Well, my squirell now has an arch-enemy. At least her's makes sense...sort of. Her enemy is a fake Yorkshire Terrior (same species as her) made entirely out of goat hair. She HATES and FEARS it. She'll shake and run from it, then suddenly dive and bite it's head. She goes crazy if someone holds it, 'cause it's getting attention and not her. I'm fairly certain she knows it's not alive, though. Maybe she just doesn't like goat-smell. In any case, she is clearly insane. Just like everyone else in my family. In other news, I participated in the Second Battle of the Asparagus Wars and chronicled them here. I'll add a link to the main page when I get around to it. It gave me new insight into how weird I am. I fought with vegitables, covered myself in bubble wrap, groveled before the Great Banana and dodge skittles and flying doughnuts and rubber chikens. The entire message board was like one big insane asylum. Needless to say, I felt right at home. Well, seeya *waves brightly* I got to go to my Grendel (really cool book) project for school. I's making fake soundtracks like the teacher told me! BYE!!! Okay...I'm back. Today's rant is a panic rant. There are not going to be conspiracies...or humor of any kind. I think. *let the panic begin!* IT'S NOT FAIR! Why do I have to work year round? I only signed up for a semester. I was looking forward to having A elective, while everyone else was enjoying three or four...or even more. Oooo..I'm a poet, and don't I know it? In any case...it's awful. It's bad enough to go to school, leave school, go to work, leave work, do homework and then wait for my dad to get off of the computer so that I can do stuff. I want SOME free time. That's all. Is that too much to ask? I spend from 8-5 doing what everyone else wants. When is it MYturn? Next semester will be almost exactly like this one. Even though my schedule is technically supposed to be completly differnt. You see, my school has "block" scheduling. That means I take four classes this semester and four different classes next year. But one of my classes is work, and two others are horrible year-round classes. So next semester I'll still have work, AP Lit, and AP Physics. It's not FAIR. Physics is so FREAKIN' hard! I don't understand it. I have no problem with Lit. Okay. Work. I love my work, I love the kids I work with. But I HATE spending three hours of every day in a "class" when everyone else's class is only an hour and a half. I don't care if I have to ride the bus home if I stop work. I don't care if I'd get home only an hour or so before I normaly do. I want an elective. Maybe. I think. All I know is that I've been assuming one thing while the person in charge has been assuming a completly different thing. Neither of us thought to question the other. And so I'm in deep doo-doo. *sniffle* I just want to have some FREAKIN' variety in my daily grind, you know? I don't WANT to do the same thing for an entire year. Yeah, I know, regular schedule schools do that. I pity them, I really do. I've spent the past three years of my life EXPECTING each semester to be like a mini-year. I DO NOT LIKE CHANGE! This is just way too much of a change at once. I don't want year-round classes. I don't want a full year of work. I don't want to be in this mess...I'm going to bed. I'm back. I don't have much of a choice about the whole work thing. Plus, the kids at the daycare (where I work, obviously) say that I'm "cool to talk to". That makes me feel alll warm and fuzzy inside. Like a muffin. They just like how I know lots of pointless laws and random facts. Okay. ON TO THE CONPIRACY OF THE DAY!: I've had this nagging fear that I am part of some random but vast conspiracy (about what I'm not sure but it must be vast). Meanwhile there is a vast conspiracy at school to keep me ignorant about my pawn roll in the other vast conpiracy by keeping me vastly bored. (In a very vast sense) And: did you ever notice that the word "conspiracy" is vastly similar to the word "constipation". I only mention this 'cause I've accidently spelled constipation instead of conspiracy a few times. (on accident, vast number of times) Hee-Hee! Isn't vast a funny word? You can just picture sterotypical pirates saying, "A vast ye mateys!". I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it sure is funny:) You don't agree? Shame on you! Code: 888 of The Flaming Chickens Handbook states that The Patron Saint of Paperclips (still me) is always right. ALWAYS. If the facts beg to differ, than the facts are wrong. End of story. Seeya. I'm back. I've been playing one of the new neopets slot machines (black pawkeet). I'm completly and totally addicted. Gambling is so much fun! I've won 500 np, at least and I'm on a roll. Now sure, I could have won more than 500 at some game in which you don't have to pay to play. But, what would be the fun in that? I even came up with a mathematical explanation for why gambling is fun (while I was eating a hyper-speed dinner, thinking nothing of getting back to the slot machine). Okay. If you don't understand the concept of numbers less than zero, (negative numbers) just skip this part. Imagine a number line that points in the positive and negative direction. When I start playing a game, I am on 0. I have neither won nor lost money/neopoints. When I win 500np on a normal game, I move to the 500 point. There is exactly 500 units of distance between the two extremes of winning amounts (0 and 500) BUT! When I play a gambling game, there is a possibility that I'll lose everything, so I start on negative however much NP I have with me. If I had 500np with me, I'd be at-500. Then, when I win 500 additional np, I move to the 500np point. The distance between the two extremes of how much I could have won is 1000np, making me feel like I've won much more than if I'd played a normal game. Did you understand that? Good. I probably won't later. But that is irrelevant. Goodbye! I am back. And I hava a very, almost special rant for you. The previous sentence made absolutly no sense. Good for it. In a recent article, humorist Dave Barry discussed the addictive quality of the snack food, Cheez-Its. Naturally, I had many mixed feelings, primarily disgust, as I have not voluntarily eaten a Cheez-It in quite some time. They're disgusting, bland and definitly not made of cheez, whatever that is. My family has always bought Cheez-Its, to the point of making me physically sick at the thought of eating one. (To this day, however, I will almost literally kill for a box of Cheez-It party mix, as it is a rare commodity at my house.) Fortunatly, my mom recently finnaly switched our snack food preference. To Cheese Nips. Say it. Out loud. What does it sound like? When you look at them they are identical to the evil little Cheez-Its. The only difference is the taste, which I enjoy, since it is new and different. What I want to know is this: are there no intelectual property rights in the world of food products? I mean, don't you think the creators of Cheese-Nips had a box of Cheez-Its out when they were designing their product? It seems like blaggerent plagerism. The only reason the makers of Cheese-Nips don't get sued is because of the tast difference and Cheese Nips are made of real "cheese" rather than cheez. It makes you think of Name-Brand vs. Generic cereal brands. They are the samething, with the same look, and almost same name. But people buy name brands. Why, because they assume it's better quality. Plus, boxes are more convient than bags. A profound statement, if I ever heard one. Any way, I'm leaving to eat some Cheessy goodness! I'm back. Apparantly my standards of weird have gone up. This morning, my Mom came home from work. She was upset, because she had accidently run over an armidillo. She said she hurt it the first time, and wanted to put it out of it's misery, so she went back and ran over it 11 more times. But it's legs were still moving and it was alive. She was extremly upset. When I related this story to my friends (including "Meg") they thought it was hilarious. They couldn't stop laughing. I thought it was sad...and normal. They particularly liked how I said that she went back and ran over it 11 more times. I'm not sure why. Of course, when I next saw my Mom, she retold the story to me, several times. With the exact same words, motions and emotions. She didn't think it was weird, either. Perhaps my family is just so weird, we've lost all sense of perspective. Or maybe it's everybody else that's weird. I just don't know. What do you think, Hypothetical Reader? You don't know either? Hmmmmm...what is this world coming to? Oh, by the way, I was paid a decent compliment today. One of my friends (who laughed at the armidillo story) named Tonileigh said "Jenny (that's me) is weirder than the average Psycho." and " You think Jenny's weird? Wait till you see her in angry mob form!" Now THAT'S just weird. "angry mob form"? That just sounds nifty! I can clone myself and form and angry mob? In anycase, this was particularly funny because Tonileigh is one of my "normaler" friends. Although I tell you she can't possibly be normal, since she hangs out with me. Anyway, I'm gonna go. I gots stuff to do! I'm back. If you'll look toward the bottom of this page, you'll notice that I added a nifty little thing called the "babel fish". It will translate any thing, to anything else. Ain't it nifty? What's really fun is to translate an English saying, like out of sight, out of mind. Then, when it's in German, or whatever, translate it back to English. It's so completly garbled, it's funny. For instance, I wrote: "I am the Crazy Taco!", and translated it to German. I then copied and pasted the German and put it in the text box. I translated it from German to English and got "I am the Moved Taco!" See? Hours of completly useless fun! This has been my hourly Public Service Announcement that I only do when I feel like it. Seeya! I'm back! Woooo! And do I ever have a topic today! I've been a paranoid, conspiracy seeking mood lately and the newest threat to my sanity is: smoke detectors! Come on, think about it! In all those 911 shows, people wake up and their house is engulfed in flames. The smoke detector either never went off, or went off and the people just slept through it. Okay, fire is loud. And hot...and smoky. If you can sleep through a raging fire, close enough to set off the smoke detector, then you are definitly going to sleep through the smoke detector. Plus, the fire gradually gets louder, and hotter, and smokier. The sleeping person will gradually get used to it (and incorporate it into their dreams). By the time the smoke dector goes off, the fire has drowned it out to no more than an annoying buzz. My point is that smoke detectors have very little value in home security. Okay, one day, in the future, smoke dectectors will probably activate litte fire-fighter bots that every home will have. But untill that day, the concept of the smoke detector is useless. If you're awake to hear it, chances are that you've already noticed the smoke, fire and eminent danger. If you're asleep, the fire will wake you. So, that leads us to the evil paranoid conspiracy I thought of the other night. What if the smoke detectors have tiny litte cameras in them? That would explain that annoying green little blinkie light in them. Unless, of course, the government was smart enough to have cameras without the blinkie light. In any case, wouldn't the blinkie light help night-vision cameras see in the dark? It only takes a little light to help those thingies, and smoke detectors provide more than a little. I can even see the shadow of my hand on the wall from the light those things shed. It's annoying. Here I am, trying to get a decent nights sleep and there's this green light that periodically blinks to red directly in front of me. It's a small light, but it's sooooooo annoying. There MUST be some sort of conspiracy involved, 'cause if there is, I can get rid of the EVIL thing! So, fellow conspiracy nuts: Take down the evil governmental safety device and take it apart. If you can still think during all that incessent beeping, you'll probably find evidence that I'm really paranoid. Or possibly right...that would be scary. In any case...I guess that smoke detectors are a neccesary evil...but...WHY DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THAT STUPID LIGHT? Does it serve an obvious purpose? No! That's why it MUST be EVIL! You cannot deny the logic of my thinking! Now...I'm gonna go and worry about the light on my toaster oven...seeya! *sighs dramatically* I'm back. It's not fair, ya know? Each Friday, I wait (all tingly with anticipation) for the weekend so that I can stay up 'till the wee hours of the morning and sleep past noon. But my idiotic body has an automatic alarm clock, or something. During the weekdays, I get about seven hours of sleep (usually less) and wake up at 6:11 a.m. Yep. Now, some of you are probably calling me a whiner, 'cause you have to get up at 4:30, or whatever. And lots of you are probably gloating 'cause you don't have to get up 'till 8:30. The reason I have to get up at 6 something is that I...I...I ride the bus to school. Yeah...I know...pathetic. (Believe me, though, you never want to see me drive...I get easily distracted by clouds and signs saying FREE KITTIES!...kitties are hugable...but if you hug them...they'll scratch your eyes out...so then you have to hiss at them and establish dominence...but kitties don't like that...even though dogs do...but kitties are obviously not dogs...even though they are fuzzy.) So...my lack of a car and driving skills force me to use the bus, which comes for me 45 minutes before my school even starts. It's stupid. It only takes me a few minutes to get ready, then I can go back to bed. Now...I bet you're wondering why I don't just wake up a few minutes before I have to go. My sister. My evil, EVIL sister. That's why. She's evil. SHE has to get up at 6:11 to put on make-up, do her hair and basically annoy the heck out of me. So rather than battle her over the concept of getting dressed in the dark, I get up. Oh...I'm rambling again, aren't I? Back to the original topic! So...when the weekend rolls around, I'm fairly exhausted. But, my stupid internal alarm clock is starting to wake me up around six. I can usually fall back asleep (if I don't panic and think I'm late for school), but the stupid thing wakes me up again exactly seven hours after I originally fell asleep. Which is why it's not even 10:00 and here I am, typing. Which I suppose may be a good thing, seeing as how I'm currently in a Longest Text Ever Rivalry with Galaxy Dreamer's site. *cough*She's winning*cough* But that's just because I have so much to do to mantain and update this site, I rarely get a chance to just sit here and type. Oh, and I would like to mention to my *snicker* LOYAL fans that this Longest Text Ever DOES get updated at least once a week, so please, please, please, PLEASE do not read this once, in one sitting and then leave forever, and ever and ever! It makes me sad...*sniffle* Well...I feel better now. Did you know that I now possess a DOMAIN NAME? Yep. That's right! It'll be ready soon, ain't it great? Okay, back to the flaming-chickens LTE rivalry. Another reason why this isn't as long as Galaxy's is that I refuse to write every day as it would--this is the funny part--LOWER THE QUALITY OF MY OVERALL WORK! HA-HA! HILARIOUS! "lower the quality"? Sometimes I crack myself up. If this was quality work, I'd publish it and make a fortune. Speaking of publishing, I do plan on somehow, someday publishing this as the first rambling narrative that makes no sense, and is about as interesting as rereading the almanac. I'd probably lose money, but the concept is interesting. I think. Anyway, I better go or the quality of this will go down in that evil downward spiral thing I discussed a few months back. Seeya. I'm back. Wooooo! I's can get to my site again! It was down for a whole day or so 'cause of all the traffic I got from my new quizes. I have an extra-special rant for you all today, to celebrate the new domain name! www.flaming-chickens.com! Okay. I am now barophobic (afraid of gravity). I recently learned in my EVIL Physics class that on average, humans lose one inch of height during the day due to gravity pushing on their spine. The height is regained at night, when you're laying down. This naturally alarmed the HECK out of me! GRAVITY IS EVIL! It's pushing down on me, squishing my spine. MY SPINE IS SQUISHY! That's is just so extremly creepy. What if, eventually, Earth's gravity get's very very strong, and we all imploud from the squishyness? It'd be like when you go to the bottom of the ocean, only with gravity instead of pressure...*shudders* Pressure is evil, too. Air pressure. Did you know that there is over two miles of air sitting on you right now? Even though air is light, that much air adds up. TWO MILES? Even the air is conspiring to squish me! If you don't believe that all that air has weight, try going into space sometime. Space is notorious for not having air. When you're in space (without a space suit) you don't SUFFUCATE, you don't FREEZE. You exploud. Since all that nifty air isn't pressin' on you, your guts and stuff are free to go wherever they want, and the EVIL little things decide to roam around. Outside your body. It's creepy. So...air pressure can be a good thing. Even though it gains pleasure from squishing my spine. That's it, I'm gonna take drastic measures! I'm gonna launch THE OFFICIAL FLAMING CHICKENS LUNAR COLONY! The moon has one-sixth of Earth's gravity. And absolutly NO air-pressure. We can all wear spiffy space-suits and feel all superiour to all those stupid earthlings. So...if you wish to contribute to this great and magneficent and magestic and MOOSEY project...we need the following things: 739 rolls of aluminium foil (preferably the extra shiny kind) 417 refridgerator boxes, 9000 rolls of "sticky on both sides" duct tape, 300 lbs of chicken feathers (preferably white) and 1 (one) thermo-nuclear-rocket-thruster. If you can spare any of these items, please e-mail them to me. Yes. E-mail. Did you really think I'd give you guys my ADDRESS? Now...I know what you guys are thinking...some of those items on that list are gonna be hard to find. Especially that duct tape. But, believe me, it's MUCH more practical than the alternative. What is the alternative, you ask? I'll tell you. Making me(The Patron Saint of Paperclips) the Ruler of the Laws of Nature! That way I can just outlaw the need for gravity and air pressure! I'm already half way there, since I conclusivly proved (in Physics class) that gravity actually causes things to slow down and EVENTUALLY GO UP! Sure, my TEACHER said that was because I was doing the problems wrong, but once I'm the Ruler of the Laws of Nature, I'll change the problems so that I'm right! Oooo! I thought of another very good reason to assist with the Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony! As we all know, the world is going to end in about 380,695 days! This means that we only have a very short while to prepare. And I sugest that we build the rocket so that we can go to the Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony so that we can laugh at the stupid earthlings who are blowing up because they didn't listen to us when we tried to warn them about the impending doom! Once we are on our Lunar Landing Site, we will engage in many exciting activites, primarily related to suffucating and starving. If (and this is a big if) the world DOES survive, we can beg them for food, oxygen and other supplies. They'll probably just call us weird and laugh at us, but that's beside the point! I can even see the Official Flaming Chicken Rocket. It'll be covered in chicken feathers, and shaped like a chicken. The foil will make up the beak and the folded legs, and the thruster can simulate the tail. It will be a truly magestic site, as it launches from the earth, spewing excess oxygen, cardboard, feathers and tape. But, act now, or it will be too late, and you will be one of the losers that we'll be laughing at, assuming we have air to laugh with. Remember, e-mail psopc@flaming-chickens.com the much needed supplies...if that is possible. If not, then some day, when the Internet is down and I'm really bored, I will construct a model OFCR and attempt to launch it. That will be a wonderous day. I think I'll get my little sister to be the test piolet. Well...better go...I need to plan this out more...I'm back. And mildly weirded-out. My dad...was on this site. My dad. It even SOUNDS weird. He took the TAB member quiz and turned out to be me, he took the JOB quiz, and was a repo man (which had a pic of my brother) He said he wanted to see what I was doing, and to make sure that I wasn't saying anything derrogatory about my parents. He looked me upvia yahoo's search engine using flaming-chicken as the keyword. It took him to my quiz page. So he probably didn't see the majority of my site. It's just weird. All along, my entire family has scoffed (nifty word, isn't it?) about my site, and called me weird. I dunno...I guess I'm just kinda freaked out. Oh, and don't forget to celebrate Mad Hatter Day on October the 6th. Seeya. I'm back. I had some conspriacy or another to rant about. But then I listened to some of the new music I put on my site and mellowed out. I can't remember what I was gonna rant about. Oh, yeah. Now I do. "Purified" water. Just wait a sec while I stop the music. *content sigh* There we go...that's much better. Now I can think. That's right, folks. "Purified" water. Now...just stop a second and contemplate that. Pure means, well, no extra stuff. 100% of something. Right? Well, next time you buy your $3 FREAKIN' dollar bottle of water, consider this. On almost all the "purified" water bottles I've ever seen it has the following mesage: "Purified through reverse osmosis. Minerals added for a pure, fresh taste." In other words, they take all that extra "stuff" out to make it pure. Then they add other "stuff" in to make it TASTE pure. But it's not. For all you, the uninformed consumer, could know, it might have rat poison in it. "Pure" water manufactuerers are not required to list the ingredients of water, because the average consumer believes that it should be obvious. But that is false! They add random minerals to our water to make it taste better, and then advertise it as pure! It's an outrage! I'd rather drink the "impure" tap water where at least I KNOW that someone, somewhere tested it. It's a law, I think. But does anyone test "pure" water? Most likely they test it BEFORE they add the extra stuff..."Yep, Bob, this is some mighty pure water." "Yep, Bill, time to dump the arsnic in so it tastes pure!" What kind of reasoning is that? Wouldn't pure water TASTE pure, and impure water TASTE impure? The insanity and stupidity is mind boggling! That's why I like fast-food salt. It actually lists what random minerals they through in to make it TASTE like salt. There's salt, of course, and aluminum sulfate, and other compounds. But the point is, if I were, say, freakily allergic to a random mineral, I could read the ingredients and not eat the salt. That's what they need to do with the water. Or, at the very least, not label it as "pure". Okay. That's the rant of the week, month, year, whatever. I'll probably have another one soon, but that whole water thing has been buggin me for awhile. Well...seeya! Er...yeah...I'm back. It's been awhile, (at least two weeks) since I've written here. I've been obsessed with various webcomics, creating the stupidly long new Phobia Quiz and being maniacly hysterical about my site always being down due to bandwith issues. I'm goin' light on the advertising at the moment, which is why I'm free to write here. I WANT to write. But I can't think of anything to write about. Typical. I finnaly get some free time to rant and rave and all my topics just magically melted away. Let's see...what have I ranted about before, subliminal messages, vast breakfast cereal conspiracies, water, uh...reality tv? And that's just what I can list from memory. Oh, yeah! How could I forget the stupid Tootsie Roll Pop Commercials? TACO is still in my heart. *sighs*...now...let's see...what to rant about today... ... ... ... ... I can't think of anything!? Is this writer's block?! Or maybe I just wanna go to bed. Sleeping is fun. Well...let's see. Did you know that statistics prove that 45% of all statistics are completly made up by me (The Patron Saint of Paperclips)? Well...they are. Ha! I see you have no reaction to that, do you Hypothetical Reader? I have once again caused that explody sensation in your brain meats! You cannot DEFEAT me! I rule the...er...*random Loyal Minion whispers in ear* That's right! I rule the Internet! The Official FLaming-Chickens Handbook already confirms that fact! You CANNOT DENY it! It says that in black and...er lime green! It MUST be true! Because it is in those veyr colors that the Matrix is programmed! Ahhh...I see your confusion! You cannot follow the vast, mind-boggling logic that is ME! Wait...how...how can I BE logic? That doesn't make any sense...you can't BE something abstract...can you? Now MY brain meats feel explody. That's not fair! I see your EVIL plot now, Hypothetical Reader! You just let me rant on and on for you KNEW that eventually I would confuse myself with my vast puddle of knowledge. You are devious...I give you that. Unfortunantly...I must leave...before the confusion spreads and I do something stupid...like revealing my one weakness before you...THAT'S IT! Code 452 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that the Patron Saint of Paperclips (ME!!!) does not, has never, and will absolutly NOT admit to having any weakness...besides the aformention indivduals own skin, which isn't even a weakness anyway since no representative of the Dark, Fluffier Side can BE the Patron Saint of Paperclips (Guess, who...no...no...THAT'S IT!) and even if they could it wouldn't do them any good because it would scare them instead of the aformentioned individual. Boy...I really enjoy confusing myself!:) Seeya! I'm baaaaa-ack! Aren't you happy? Here, see if you can find the super-secret message!
While you wait for yesterday's tomorrow, lunge back and remember that day.  You know the one.  Yeah, this doesn't mean anything to you.  Are you surprised?  Obviously not.  Answer me, you blobby looking freak! Or suffer my blindingly moronic nail messages.

Did you find it? Wasn't it super? And secret? I thought it was. But then, I'm me...and you're you. I think. I'm pretty sure you're not me...but you could be that other guy. Yeah...that...guy...you know who I'm talking about. No? Do not MOCK me! I know where you are right now! Spooky, huh? Ooooo...time for today's topic. My favorite stuff...JTHM...I have my libraries copy of JTHM...I shall quote Noodle Boy for you:) (Full copyright/credit to Jonhnen Vasquez for writin' the stuff, I'm just sharing the spleeny goodness with you). (it's edited, of course, to stay PG13...**** signifies a random naugty word:)) "HEY, DOG ENTITY! RISE UP AND BARE YOUR BISCUIT FILTY FANGS AT THE LEASH WIELDING DEMON!! **** MY NAVEL ITCHES!! MEOW!MEOW!MEOW! CAT CHOW!!! CEASE YOUR FLATULENT WINDS AND HEAR MY MIND NUMBING EXPULSIONS OF WICKED NOISE! GRRR!! CHEESE!!! I SENSE YOUR ENVY OF MY NECK!! AND I DONT BLAME YOU!! DROOOOOL OVER MY MAGICAL POWERS!! I HAVE POWERS PINTO BEANS CAN ONLY DREAM OF! WANNA SEE ME PULL A TAPEWORM OUTTA MY ****!! HUH?!...STARE DEEP INTO THE STINKING ABYSS OF MY INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED SLICES!!! HOLY WAX! CHECK OUT MY ARMPITS!!! HEEEEY! WAIDAMINIT!! WAIT JUST A POLYP PICKING MINUTE!! I SEE YOUR GAME!

AND THAT IS WHY TOASTER PASTRIES WILL BURST INTO FLAMES IF YOU DON'T KEEP AN EYE ON THEM! Now, wasn't that entertainment. I added to the lenghth of the LTE without even thinking! That's talent. Lots of gooey talent. Unfortunatly, I once again am devoid of a topic. And any weirdness I could come up with would be normal compared to Noodle Boy, so...I bid thee farewell...seeya! I'm back. And I've realized that I am a complete idiot. For an ENTIRE MONTH I have possesed the arcane knowledge, but I forgot to share it with you, my loyal potentially imaginary reader. I know. You're shocked at my selfish, bad, memory. I apologize from the depths of my moosey soul. For, you see...my life long goal has been fufilled...*anticipatory silence*...THERE ACTUALLY IS GRAPE PIE!!!! I know...you are as shocked as I am. One day I was randomly looking up images via Google...and 'lo and behold, there it was. Grape Pie. It was as if it had been just sitting there...waiting for me to discover it. Apparantly Grape Pie isn't mainstream, but it has existed for some time. In obscure cookbooks. Well...that just makes me filled with gooey happiness. Of course, there is also regret...after all, I could have made a fortune if I'd been the first to think of it. Oh, well. There was something else I had to tell you loyal *cricket chirps, someone coughs* fans. I can't remember what. I guess I'll just rant and rave about that whole vicious downward spiral of my writing. I mean, I KNOW people are coming here...I have proof! *holds up a piece of paper, which, from a distance, appears to have writing on it* Yes, undenyable proof! But this proof degrades this mysterious, mystical and mystifying "quality" of my words. After all, how can I be self derisive, and full of low expectations for this site if I KNOW people are here...several thousand of them in fact, in just a few months. It's strange. I felt more fufilled when this site was a barren wastland of useless space. But, if it had remained that way, I would have had no impetus to continue my pointlessly insane ranting. Oh, speaking of insane, I STILL need those much needed supplies for the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony! No one has even bothered to e-mail them to me...*sniffle*. I needs the duct tape! How can I survive without the sticky goodness? HOW, I ask you!? It cannot be...hmmmm...maybe I should just use IMAGINARY duct tape...it's easier to come by ,but it's much more expensive...I'm not sure what to do. *enter Squirell* What's that, little Squirell? That's just silly. You KNOW I ran out of imaginary money last week when I bought that imaginary country. WHAT!? Just "imagine" I have more!? What a crazy idea. So crazy it just might work! *scrunches eyes and makes funny sounds* Nope. It didn't. I guess I'll just have to wait untill my imaginary clone hijacks that imaginary bank truck. Until then...I have absolutly no imaginary money. What ever shall I do? I won't be able to feed my various imaginary pets and friends their beloved imaginary food! Squirell? You gots extra money, don't you? *nods* I thought so. You give to me? No? I gives you imaginary IOU's...here...yours. Thank you Squirell. *Squirell wanders off in search of electrical sockets to sniff* What's that, Hypothetical Reader? You don't know who Squirell is? You haven't been paying attention have you? She's my little puppy...she fears grape flavored stuff, wind, rain, television, noise, silence, small children and pretty much everything. She likes sniffing potentially dangerous stuff, like electrical sockets. Surely you have heard of her? Still no? Oh, well. You know...I enjoy having these conversations with you. It really lets me get to know you. What's that? You say I'm really just talking to myself? What an eccentric idea! To think, YOU are trying to tell ME that YOU aren't here. How absurd. After all, I'm talking to you, aren't I? *nods* Well, yeah...I KNOW I'm actually typing instead of talking. Wait a minute...so you're saying that I'm talking and responding to you, but you won't be reading this until long after I have finished typing? Now who's the crazy one? For that theory to work, I'd have to be psychic...or in possesion of a freaky time-traveling computer. Because what you're saying is that I'm talking to people in the future. That my words somehow travel accross time (if only a few minutes) and are somehow picked up by future you, and that my responses are dictated by future you's reactions. What? You mean that I'm just randomly responding regardless of your reactions? Why, that would be insane, wouldn't it? That's the point you're trying to get across? *pauses* Oh. I see. You wanna play that way. Well...two can play by THOSE rules. You wanna try to convince me I'M crazy? Well, look at you? How do you know I even exist? For all you know you could be staring at that freaky 3-D maze screen saver with a blank look on your face while you THINK you're reading an inhumanly long text. For all you know, you could be halucinating my entire site! For that matter, how do you know that ANYTHING but you exists! You could be floating out in empty space, conjuring nice little fantasies to relieve the monotony of being the only living being! Every single person you know could just be figments of your imagination, you could even be in a crazy house! Not only that, but how do you know that YOU actually exist? You could be the figment of someone else's dream. What would happen when that dreamer woke? Are you happy? You got me started. I may NEVER shut up. I'll just go on and on about how crazy you COULD be. All because YOU tried to convince me that I was crazy. *blinks* And I STILL can't remember what else I was gonna say to you people. Strange, huh? Well, I better leave before I go on and on about more "reality" theories. Makes you wonder about "reality" television, huh? Seeya. I'm back. Grrrr...I had a nifty rant all planned out in my head. And then I was unable to get on the computer and I forgot most of it. Oh, but I did remember what else I wanted to say to you people. Remember that rant I did on how there could be a secret camera in the smoke detector? I few months ago I saw a movie about that. It was pretty good. Maybe I'd seen it before, and that's where I got the idea. I forgot it's name. Well...I DO have a special treat for you weirdos who apparantly like wasting time! Today, in my (Honors) English class, we did group work. My group...well...we either went hysterical or crazy, I can't decide which. We had to do an essay on a book. There was a sample essay online. It sucked. It tooked about envelooping (enveloping) cracked nuts and parables. So we were already off to a bad start. Here is the sum total of my group's work. (Note: I wrote virtually none of this, so I cannot be blamed, credited with any of this. "Lots of death, lots and lots of death in this section. Death is like life in that after you die some things start life again inside of you. 'Ah the power of cheese!' The author's vision was unique in that only he put biscuits and death in the same sentence. 'I found nothing else to do but to offer him on of my good Swede's ship's biscuits I had in my pocket'" And we're supposed to be GOOD in English! We KNEW how terrible it was, but we just didn't bother to change it. Especially the part about the biscuits and cheese. We just picked random words in the selection and wrote about them. It was sad. In any case, I hope you enjoyed our patheticness. Seeya! I'm back. Today I will be mercifully brief. I am here to bring AWARNESS to your moosey soul! Right now, while you are sitting in your "chair" and eating your "junk food", millions of almonds are commiting suicide. Yes...that's right...suicide. I was alerted to this growing problem in our world community by (Kat, the ruler of all that is almondy)...and it greatly concerns me. People just don't realize that their almonds and mixed nuts may be having depression and other problems. We need to act now! For more information, e-mail EnpuUnknown@msn.com Well...seeya! I'm so very, very tired. Today was Halloween. I worked for four hours at the "Library of Terror" sponsered by TAB. TAB members got pizza...lots of pizza...and candy. Ugh. It was fun, but exhausting. I was almost completly covered in (fake) blood...it was sticky toward the end. One guy was a "shock therepy" patient...he was a good actor. He acted like he was really being tortured and stuff. I'm tired. I bet you couldn't tell. Why am I writing? Because this is the first time I've been on a computer all day. You can't blame me. Don't worry, I'll go to bed soon. In the mean time, I'll just sit here and type with my eyes closed. It's hard to type because of the bandaid on my finger. I accidently cut it with scizzors. It hurt. The fake blood seeped into the open wound. Gee...I sure hope it wasn't poisonous. If so, I guess I won't be writing here for quite awhile...seeya. Okay, this next rant has nothing to do whatsoever with Halloween...which is to be expected because it's been several days since then. Anyway, today's rant is about one of my many and various pet peeves: fasion and...stuff. My definition of fasion includes clothes, shoes, jewelery and all things of that nature. Now, don't get me wrong. I can appreciate a spiffy black outfit as much as the next person, but everytime I consider actually buying clothes for aesthetic value, I think about how I could better spend my money. On video games. Sure, some of this "fasion" stuff is cool and all, but all it shows is that you had the three and three-quarters brain cells required to copy someone else's "look". And don't even get me started on earrings. My little, eviler sister got her ears pierced when she was relativly younger. My mom did it to her because it was free. OF FREAKIN' COURSE IT WAS FREE! Just like thos so called "diet supplements" that give you a "free" sample because they know that once you try it, you'll like it so much you'll spend oodles of cash on it. (There's probably drugs in it). Anyway, like the "diet supplement" people, the earring manufacturers KNOW that once they pierce you, you'll be hooked for life. *pauses* *groans* I'm sorry for that pun (pierced, hooked, getit?). AS soon as you're pierced, you have to buy "starter" earrings. Then you'll need an "extra" pair...for special occasions. Before you know it you'll realize that you need Christmas earrings, Halloween earrings, Valentine's Day earrings, St. Patrick's Day earrings, for crying out loud! You'll wear these "festive" earings for about a day and then abandon them in some dark cranny of your closet because you simply can't wear the same earrings two years in a row for heaven's sake! Then you'll see these cute little "days-of-the-week" earrings at the mall, and you'll just have to get a few sets, just in case you lose some. By the time you're eighty, you'll have enough ear jewelry to open up your own jewelry shop. Of course, you won't want to do that becuase you still need more earrings so people won't think you wear the same ones over and over again. When I think of how much money people WASTE on appearences, it makes me feel like projectile vomiting. If that's not a vast conspiracy, then nothing on this Earth is. Now, I'm not speaking from personal experience here. No one I know is that obsessed with earrings, it was just an example. (Although my mother does have a "earring tree".) Sure, certain members of my family do pay WAY to much attention to fasion, but that's just because of the expectations of society. I, being weird, am pretty much immune to such expectations. Except those specially formulated for weird-o's like me. If I were to suddenly convert this entrie site into a *shudders* Backstreet Boys fan site or something, you wouldn't be any more suprised than I would be if my brother woke up one day and suddenly realized that he's shallow. It's the same concept. (No, I don't like any of those creepy "pop" stars. I think that they should routinly die a slow, savage, agonizing death...I was just saying a random thing that I would never, ever do.) Well...any way...seeya! I'm back. And today's rant is a sort of philosophical one. It's about the (supposedly) infinite nature of the universe. Suprised? It's spiffy. You see, if the universe is indeed infinite, that means that literally EVERYTHING is possible, and in fact, is happening somewhere in the universe. Think about it. No matter how unlikely something is, if the universe is infinite, it's happening an infinite number of times. Think about that old saying about "If you gave an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters, eventually they would reproduce the entire works of Shakespear". That makes complete and total sense! Anyone just randomly typing letters will eventually accidently write a word, right? Now think of 100 people typing randomly. You figure that one of those 100 people would actually have a coherent phrase. And one out of a million people would probably have a few sentences. So if you have an infinite number of people, some are going to have entire books of coherent stuff. And, you have to remember that because infinity is infinite, you can divide it an infinite number of times. Try it. If you have a decent graphing calculator, plug in the infinity symbol divided by anything, (even infinity). The answer is still infinity. Using my philosopy, that EVERYTHING exists because the universe is infinite...well...think about it. In some far off world, there are pokemon...there are an evil race of muffin like creatures, there is a world with ABSOLUTLY NO COMMERCIALS DURING TELEVISION! I know, unlikely, huh? But somewhere, it exists. Think about it. If the universe is infinite it would be crazy to think that we're alone. With an infinite universe, there are infinite possibilites. There ARE aliens. Not only that, but there are an infinite number of different kinds of intelligent life. Which means that there are an infinite number of worlds with humanoid life. (Think of the fake-looking Star Trek aliens). If there are an infinte number of worlds with human life, than there are an infinte number of worlds that have someone exactly like you, with only a few key differences. (Like alternate dimensions and stuff) So, there is a world where you are the creator of this Longest Text Ever. There is a world where you are a faerie. There is a world where you were never born. There is a world where you are a slave to your TOASTER OVEN. The possibilities are literally endless. Every fantasy the human mind has concieved exist at some place in the universe. There are an infinite number of worlds with Harry Potter. Think about it. I came up with this philosophy when I was in fifth grade. I'd tell it to my little brother as a bed time story. He always enjoyed it because it meant that somewhere, he was the Supreme Dictator of the Galaxy. That made him happy. He ignored the fact that he was also a 72 year old "sanitation engineer" somewhere. All the good possibilities effectivly cancel out the bad ones, leaving the sum total of you and your counterparts experiences as nothing. You don't have the best life of your counterparts, but you don't have the worst either. Because that would be impossible. There is always someone worse off and better off than you. Because there are an infinite number of people on either side of the spectrum. Confusing, huh? But that's the kind of thing I like. That also explains why normal stuff confuses me. I'm sure some so called "scientist" can prove all my theories wrong...but how? How do you PROVE something is not infinite? You'd have to find the end, of course. But how, may I ask, can you find the end of the FREAKIN' universe? What, is there a giant sign saying, "DEAD END"? The universe is EVERYTHING, how can it end? At the same time, how can you prove something IS infinite? You could travel in a straight line at the speed of light for a million years and all you'd prove is that the universe is really, really big. But you'd never prove it was infinite. How could you? Our mind's cannot conceive of the vastness of infinity. We'd probably go crazier. In any case, my theory means that playing video games is very cruel. Why, you ask? Because in some world, the video game is real. So when you kill, or whatever, in the game, you are actually ending life somewhere in the universe. Of course, you also end life by sneezing, eating, sleeping, and watching T.V. According to my theory that everything is real. Of course, if everything is real...then the Universe is pretty contradictory. The paradox of my system of beliefs leads me to believe that the universe, in fact, is not infinite. Because nature supposidly abhors a paradox. Although, as I said, there's no way to prove me wrong OR right. That's what I like about making abstract theories... Anyway, sorry for the lack of relative weirdness, conspiracy theories and doughnuts (my Moose ate them all). Well...now that I think about it...according to my theory, ALL conspiracies are real and mislabled "paranoid" people are really the only ones who see the truth. *blinks* Wow...so I'm NOT paranoid. Who'da thought it? Well...better go before one of my two and half sane readers falls asleep:) Seeya! I'm back! Boy, are you mythical, mystical readers in for a treat, today! I have a guest rant/fake commercial written by "Meg" (who is once again banned from accessing the almighty Internet). Are you ready? No? Too Bad! The magic eight-ball glows with knowledge! With a shake, the future is revealed! The magic eight-ball is a plastic casing with an unknown, possibly toxic liquid inside. The future is determined by the triangles, in a startling blue color which spin around in a zany manner. Wheather you're saved or doomed, find out now! Is that old lady on the street corner really an ex-convict? Is fat-free food more delicious than food loaded with fat? Is your school playground a gateay to the underworld? All this information and more is yours for the low, low price of 5 payments of $29.99! And, if you call within the next ten minutes you get a free eight ball with the one you buy! But wait! There's more! Get the free Lil' Ball for your traveling needs! Warning: this product is illegal in most states) Wasn't that entertaining? "Meg" wrote it for a school assignment. We were supposed to write about a cherished child-hood toy, and attempt to turn our fond memories into a commercial. I wrote about furby, and how it was fun to watch it die. No, really. Somehow, I managed to make my furby die. It would sneeze, then start it's eight-hour-long death hum. It would hum, and hum, and hum...and then mercifully die. I don't exactly have a good track record with virtual pets. I once...*embarassed pause* had "Hey, You! Pikachu!"...a pokemon game. I'll only say that it was the first game you could "talk" to and was the first (and only) N64 virtual pet. Pikachu...well...he didn't like me. I gave him cupcakes, and presents, and did everything I could to befriend him! And what did he do to me? He snuck up on me one day in our room (in the game) with a sword! That's right, a sword! He tried to kill me! I heard something and turned around, and there he was! He even tried to hide the sword behind his back! When I tried to talk to him, he tossed it away nonchalantly and pretended he hadn't heard me. Then he preceeded to trash my room, scattering kleenex everywhere. I'm pretty sure that the "smelly yellow ball" that he started throwing was his own feces (poo). That dirty little rat. Awwww...isn't he cute? Hmmmm...I suppose I should clarify that the Pikachu game was 3-D and your character was in first person mode(you see through character's eyes). Otherwise you'd think I was delusional, or something. Everyone I know who has played that game is shocked when I tell them...oh, well. Speaking of virtual pets, I'm revamping the ones on this site. I've finnally figured out sorta, maybe, kinda, how to do stuff to make it more real. Anyway, seeya! OOooooo! I'm back, and I had yet another Asparagus War with some people. We made a guild, and I wrote out the transcripts of the first ever Asparagus War in narrative form (mock epic, very cheesey) Since it's very, very long, I'll post it here to meet my imaginary word quota for the day! Oh, and all those weird squiggly lines and symbols, those are supposed to be apostrophes, but neopet's code is weird, and I'm not gonna bother to edit it. Enjoy!
And, on the 15th day of the Month of August, in the year of our Lord 2003, at approximately 7:52 p.m. a great and wondrous battle was fought in the waste lands of the General Chat Room. â€˜Lo, and eon337 did wield the mighty Swiss-Asparagus, and did attempt to vanquish her foe, the Evil and Fluffy preggypreggy. Preggypreggy had tamed the fearsome Asparagus Sword, and many a foe had she slain with her valor. But behold! For the Swiss-Asparagus did slice, and dice and was capable of turning itself into julienne fries! And so it seemed that the two mighty warriors were evenly matched and that their struggle would never come to and end. They didst charge at each other with a terrible noise and clamor, and the skies did shake and the earth did tremble at the ferocity of their mighty blows! The stereotypical Asparagus Sword didst fail to hit its mark and eon337 did mock the Sword for itâ€™s falling.

Translation: On 8-15-03, 7:52 NST, eon337 and preggypreggy grabbed some Asparagus Themed weapons and fought. They made fun of each otherâ€™s weapons, and generally kept missing each other every time they swung.
And eon337 did think long and ponderous and in so doing converted the puny Swiss-Asparagus into the mighty and powerful toothpick. And the masses did gleam the significance of this act and they were awed by the grace and cunning of the wooden speck. And preggypreggy was immune to the verbal slings and arrows of her foe, and refused to be disheartened by eon337â€™s dishonorable insults. Her claim being that function of a weapon is to be put before the ornate form. She endeavored to thwart eon337â€™s plans to defeat her with the great and wondrous toothpick. She didst again pummel the air with her sword, but in her enthusiasm her blows didst fall far from their mark. And the masses didst cheer for eon337 as she had impressed them greatly and they made the sounds of impressive wonder.
Translation: Eon337 turned a perfectly good Swiss-Asparagus into a toothpick to gain the approval of the studio audience. The audience oooed and awed. Preggypreggy continued to swing wildly around, missing each time. She ignored eon337â€™s insult and said that at least her sword worked.
And then a new challenger didst arrive at the arena and scoobychick6900 didst fling bowls of asparagus at the fighting mortal enemies. Preggypreggy appealed to the masses, but to no avail, and was heartily surprised when the asparagus did hit her. And â€˜Lo! The masses didst condemn scoobychick6900 loudly and vehemently and there was much rejoicing in the land. Preggypreggy didst fancy that she had perhaps met scoobychick6900 previously, and so did attempt to recollect when. Eon337 did take advantage of the lull in action and did attack preggypreggy with her finger. Preggypreggy did retaliate with the awe-inspiring SuperPoke, and eon337 was laid low upon the ground in agony.
Translation: Scoobychick6900 showed up and threw bowls of asparagus. Eon337 poked preggypreggy, and preggypreggy poked back, harder. Eon337 was hurt.
And with victory in her mighty vision, preggypreggy didst decide to reveal her secret weapon, and with a fancy hand movement, revealed the extent of her traitorous ways. For all know that the bagels and the doughnuts didst disband in ancient times of old. Preggypreggy, through her treacherous methods, had obtained the Flying Doughnut of Doom and didst endeavor to use it. Eon337 was readily prepared for such an occurrence and didst arm herself with mighty ear-shields, armor that didst repel all projectiles of metal, a head covering, and an outer covering of strange, transparent material that didst snap whence it was squeezed. Aragorns_cutie then didst show up with the almighty nemesis broccoli and an unnecessary sneer upon her countenance. _Radical_girl_ did break the protocol and didst claim to rather fight with cucumbers, and so it was done. And the masses rejoiced. And eon337 didst not hear the newcomers because of her mighty ear-shields, and didst offer the fighters dressings for their wounds.
Translation: Preggypreggy revealed that she had a secret weapon from Ancient Times, although eon337 was prepared for it, with earmuffs, bulletproof armor, and bubble wrap. Two new fighters showed up and did random things. Eon337 offered Band-Aids.
And aragorns_cutie didst laugh in a manic way, and didst wave the broccoli to and fro in a threatening manner. And eon337 did finally recognize the newcomers, and ask, neigh, commanded they give preggypreggy healing strips. And _radical_girl_ didst howl furiously and implored the fighters to meet their DOOOOOOOOM. And so hiamplidude didst come to the battle and didst posses the almighty Asparagus Cannon, and did thinkest himself invincible. Following himaplidude camst nemmisis_dude, who didst offer the warriors ponderous messages such as: THIS TRULY WORKS! POST THIS IN 10 DIFFERENT BOARDS AND YOU WILL FIND A BABY PAINTBRUSH WHEN YOU GO TO CHAT PREFERENCE AND 10000000000NPS! THIS TRULY WORKS, TRUST ME. And the warriors didst consider nemmisis_dude a profit, who was devoted to speaking in tongues so as to convey a message from the gods. And â€˜Lo! Nemmisis_dude didst reveal his Bow and Asparagus and the masses rejoiced. And eon337 didst intimidate her foes by snapping her transparent covering and shrieking that she was invincible.
Translation: Random stuff happened, and more people showed up. Someone spammed the message board so people ignored it and eon337 went crazier
And â€˜Lo! The writer of this cheesy epic didst realize that virtually every sentence begins with â€œandâ€, and the masses rejoiced. _radical_girl_ didsâ€™t chase random people with her broccolis, and didst miss in her mighty swings. Hiamplidude didst take out nemmisis_dude, and gloried in his honor and didst receive a spinach gun from the gods. . Preggypreggy was threatened by the randomness, and didst call her secret weapon, the Mighty Evil Flying Donut Of Doom! Eon337 realized preggypreggyâ€™s unprecedented treachery and didst cower in her impotence before one so Dark and Fluffy. And aragorns_cutie had ex-lax and _radical_girl_ didst covet invincibility and so did don a pool covering. Nemmisis_dude was revealed to be unharmed by hiamplidude, and didst fire at preggypreggy with an asparagus gun. But preggypreggy didst forget one thing: eon337 still possessed the support of the ignorant masses, which guaranteed her inevitable victory. And preggpreggy scoffed at eon337â€™s supposed advantage and didst claim that even the ravenous horde of the people didst not conceive of her one vulnerable point. And preggypreggy didst close her mind to the truth: the dark side is fluffy.
Translation: Preggypreggy called the Flying Donut of doom and eon337 called preggypreggy a traitor. The newcomers did random tings, and eon337 reminded everyone that she still had the support of the studio audience. Preggypreggy refused to see it as an advantage, and refused to believe that she was on the Dark, Fluffier Side.
And behold, for eon337 didst transform the Asparagus Toothpick into a Aspara-Launcher and didst call preggypreggy deceived in her way of thinking, for the Dark Side is always Fluffier. And preggypreggy didst call forth the creamed cheese from the bowels of the Evil Flying Donut of Doom and the masses did rejoice, and wallowed in the fattening substances that fell from the air like a gift of mana from the gods. And eon337 didst fire projectiles at preggypreggy and unexpectedly mimicked the holy Matrix in her cries of â€œDodge thisâ€. And neoshadow08 didst arrive and inquire as to whether rubber chickens were allowed, and the multitudes said yes. Preggypreggy, in her infinite wisdom, failed to see the connection between Darkness and Fluffiness, and was so forsaken by the masses. And greyratt didst claim to have invented a new, spookier type of asparagus that never caught on, and the multitudes rejoiced. Preggypreggy didst dodge the projectile, and gained honor amongst the masses. As the theological debate about the Dark, Fluffier Side raged on, the newcomers fought with the dung of dogs, the chickens of rubber and other such unorthodox weaponry as greyratt didst play with discarded asparagus.
Translation: Some stuff happened here. No, really! Eon337â€™s toothpick became an Aspara-Launcher, and preggypreggy and eon337 argued about whether the Dark Side was Fluffy or not. Neoshadow08 and greyratt came, and did stuff. Preggypreggy released cream cheese from the Flying Donut of Doom.
And eon337 didst revealth that she didst posses the Ultimate Asparagus Themed Weapon, too terrible to be named, oh, what the heckth, the name didst ring and was The Thermo-Asparagus-Nuclear-Weapon. And preggypreggy didst begin to crack under the strain of the Squeak of Death, and so in his infinite understanding, neoshadow08 didst remove the Squeak of Death and didst replace it with the Chic Attack. Aragorns_cutie didst protest the violence, and didst consume the flavorful tomato paste. And moonbeam998 didst come, a magical priestess full of arcane knowledge. Her mighty glance didst fall upon the warriors and she didst proclaim: THIS TRULY WORKS! POST THIS IN TEN DIFFERENT BOARDS AND YOU WILL FIND A BABY PAINTBRUSH WHEN YOU GO TO CHAT PREREFERENCE AND 10000000000NPS! THIS TRULY WORKS, TRUST ME! And the warriors were mystified by her meaning, but verily they didst decide that it meant for them to continue their holy battle, in the name of whatever great and mysterious god moonbeam998 didst represent. Scoobychick6900 didst return to pummel the warriors with bowels of asparagus, as in times of old.
Translation: Eon337 got out the Thermal-Asparagus-Nuclear-Weapon, and neoshadow08 stopped squeaking and started the Chick Attack. Yet another person spammed the message board, and was equally ignored. Scoobychick6900 returned.
And neoshadow08â€™s baby chickens didst fall unto the warriors from the sky, and didst pummel the brave fighters unmercifully. And scoobychick6900 didst offer to the warriors magical rainbow colored pellets, which she didst hurl at them forcefully with a gun. The magic pellets were then revealed to be the chickenâ€™s only weakness. And the warriors were locked in a deadly struggle, each using their unique methods and weapons. And the masses didst rejoice yet again. And then â€˜Lo! For preggypreggy was forced to valiantly flee the battlefield, and acceded the victory to eon337. And the masses looked confused. Eon337 didst admit that preggypreggy didst fight a valiant battle. Skuld815 didst arrive and didst proclaim the battle strange and didst fling M & Mâ€™s at the warriors. And scoobychick6900 didst proclaim that Rice Krispies were much more powerful than other weapons, and didst think that she was the only warrior left. She did wail with despair as she didst discover that eon337 remained in the land of the living.
Translation: Neoshadow08 caused chickens to fall from the sky, and scoobychick6900 fired skittles at people. Preggypreggy had to leave, and skuld815 showed up. Scoobychick6900 thought she was the last fighter left, but was not.
And eon337 and scoobychick6900 were locked in a deadly struggle, candy versus vegetables. And neoshadow08 didst summon the Great Banana for advice, and the masses were stunned. Oh, the ground did shake, and the mountains trembled. The very stars became irregular in their rotations. And so the Great Banana was called, and it was good. And scoobychick6900 revealed that she had indeed blasphemed against the Great Banana and she didst quake in terror and attempted to corrupt eon337 into blaspheming as well. And shadow9441414 didst arrive with two prodigious asparagus swords. And spicychibie didst arrive and was proven to be crazier than all others, and the masses were impressed. Behold! Eon337 didst prostrate herself before the might of the Great Banana and didst beg for his aid in defeating scoobychick6900, and the Great Banana didst forgive eon337 and giveth her a banana. And spicychibie didst partake of the asparagus and didst faint. And the Great Banana didst advise eon337 to not rely on the strength of others, but to rely on the strength within. And scoobychick6900 didst appeal to the Great Banana and didst beg for forgiveness. And the Great Banana didst not make a reply, but instead didst close his eyes and did a perfect mimicry of sleep. And scoobychick6900 didst blasphemy again and didst explode bombs of rainbow color. And eon37, in the callow impatience of youth, didst detonate the Thermal-Asparagus-Nuclear-Weapon. And the masses were blown away. As the smoke, and rubble and debris were dissipated, behold! The Great Banana was vanquished! And eon337 didst lament this fate, for her weapon hadst been aimed at scoobychick6900. And scoobychick6900 didst revel in the defeat of the Great Banana, and didst stab at eon337 with its decapitated stem. And neoshadow08 was forced to choose sides, and â€˜Lo he choose eon337! And the warriors didst depart, if not friends, then less angry enemies. And so ends the first of: The Asparagus Wars Chronicles.
Translation: While eon337 and scoobychick6900 fought, neoshadow08 called the Great Banana. Scoobychick6900 claimed to have eaten the banana the previous night, and feared the bananaâ€™s wrath. The Great Banana was defeated, and everyone decided that the war was over.
Wasn't that entertaining? Seeya! I'm back! Woooooooooooo! Guess what? Yep! *happy wiggle dance* I gots the first shipment of the much needed (pictures of) supplies for the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony! Woooooo! I feels the happy! This has been a short announcment to document the happy wigglienss that is me. Seeya! I'm back. And vaguely depressed. For the longest time, random people have been coming to my site, and staying 0.00 seconds! How is this possible? Do they not even look at my site? How can they be so cruel, to click, but not look? Grrr.... I asked Santa why this was so...but he doesn't talk to me anymore, after that incident when I was a kid. You see...*start wavy flashback lines and dreamy music* When I was a kid...or whatever...I asked Santa for nuclear warheads, helicopters, tanks...and possibly legions of doom. No, seriously! (I was twelve and forced to communicate with Santa so that my younger siblings did not guess the truth...(what truth?)...there is no spoon. (badly done Matrix parody)) Anyway...Santa didn't come through. The creep! How was I supposed to conquer the world without those supplies? All I got was a Lion King video and other random stuff. How did this help me? I vowed revenge against Santa...after all, it would have benefited him to help me. Once I was the Undisputed Lord of the Universe, the world would have been a spooky place. And all the little children wouldn't have been "good" anymore, since they would be free of thier Authoritarian Parental Units and the definition of "good" (to a parent, at least) is to obey your parents and not embarrass them. Soooooo....Santa would have had it easier. No "good" children would have meant that Santa could have had a permanent vacation in the Bahahmas, not molested by my Legions of Doom because after all--he had delivered the world to me in a brightly wrapped gift box. The man would have been more trusted than my trusted Lieutenants! (funny word...had to use spell check to spell it ^^;;) But that jolly old IDIOT had to mess things up. So, to get back at him I not only continued to not believe in him, I attempted to convert all the miniony children at my disposal...(okay not really, the idea just occured to me)...so I ask you *cough* Loyal Reader, to immediatly cease believing in Santa. I figure that--like Tinkerbell--he will evenutally perish if he doesn't have enough people believing in him. What is this? You wish to rule the world, too? Well, you can't! It's mine! Blasphemy! You dare to challenge MY rule? You are a fool! Okay...yeah...my whole Santa plot IS kinda dumb...but that's just a front so that you never guess my REAL plot! That's right....cower before my power! *insert evil, insane cackle here* I shall defeat you, Anonymous (another tricky word) Reader! Gah! I'd better go before you trace my location thorugh the Internet and send your Governmental Spyders to me! Ooops...I gave you an idea, didn't I? Well, don't use it! It's mine, you are a copy cat! Seeya *appropriate evil glare* I'm back! And, seeying as you MUST be tired of MY ranting, I have a special treat for all you hypothetical two and a half readers out there! You get ranting from somebody else! I won't bother to introduce them, since they do a good job of it themselves...here we go: Hiya. This is not PSOPC today. This is PSOCB (Patron Saint of Carbonated Beverages). We are the two original Head Saints, but for some reason, she gets all the attention. Guess I should get out of bed once in a while huh. Originally, I thought up the whole Patron Saints of the Order of the Flaming Chicken (when I should have been taking notes in Trig), but PSOPC is more creative and she elaborated on it more so. I was drawing "suppressed rage in bunny form" comics then and didn't care. I must say, she's gotten very good at thinking randomy thoughts, whereas, I'm just stoopid and something dumb pops out of my brain like floppy bacon from a toaster. I drank half a bottle of soy sauce today just to see if it gave me x-ray vision, but alas, I had nothing I wanted to look through (okay, I'm lying. I drank the whole thing on a dare.). By the way, soy sauce is gross. Who invented it? --"Why gee whiz, Bert! I think we should mix soy beans with water and have chinese for lunch!!"--"Why, indubitoubly Samson! Not only will it taste like crap, we'll get the runs!!!"-- If you don't know what the "runs" are, consult old people, like my dad. If you are in high school or college and have a job, this works great. When I call in sick (when I'm sick of working, not actually sick), I always have nosey bosses who want to know exactly what my symptoms are and how bad. I found a way to make them not WANT to know. I told my sister to try it once and it worked for her too. You just call up work, use a very retarded, slow, lisping voice when you say this: --"Weeelllllllll, I woked up this mornin' with a terrible headache so I took some aspirin with theraflu. By the way, those don't mix too good, now I have a tummy ache, my nose is runny and bleedin', my spleen feels like its gonna 'splode, I'm a tad gassy, and I got the RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!-- At this point, you'll want to use an annoying high-pitched growly voice (think drunk Barney from The Simpsons after sucking helium balloons), raspberry a few times with your toungue and hang up. I have much to do now, so thus ends this portion of my guest rant. I'll probably want to do this a few more times just because I can. Weeee Bye now! I bet you, loyal *hmmm...I don't want a cricket...maybe a nice annoying gnat or something...okay...instead of the cricket...* readers can't wait for the next time I don't rant! Right? Weeeellll...I DO have a topic for today...a topic so wonderful that it will also be included in the next OFCEM! What is this magical topic, you ask? Why, opposite day, of course! You see...er...well...how should I begin? Opposite day is, of course a day in which everything you say means the exact opposite. It is practiced (informally) by many elementary schoolers. I honor this er...honored tradition. But, to my dismay, I discovered a fatal flaw with opposite day. By my reasoning...it COULD NOT EXIST! Yes...I know...blasphemy, right? But it could not be disputed. If you were to tell someone that it WAS opposite day they would have to take the opposite of what you just said which would mean that it WASN'T opposite day. And, of course, if you were to tell someone that it WASN'T opposite day there would be no reason for them to take the opposite of what you said and so it still WOULDN'T be opposite day! Confusing, huh? But I have now seen the light! The answer to this moral dilema has been so neatly resolved, by Jesse. He is er...well...I'm not sure how old...but he is in the third grade. He is either a genius...or really weird like me (Come on, be honest...how many of you random people have put any though into opposite day...or even know about it?) He said that to make it opposite day...*dramatic pause in which the PSOPC stares into space vacantly*...all you had to do was say that it would be opposite day in 5 seconds! PURE GENIUS! Since it is not yet opposite day, you don't have to take the opposite of the statement and so can take it at face value! Do you care, Loyal *gnat/cricket sound* Reader? *stunned* You don't!? Why ever not!? It is the most important discovery since...since...er...since...GRAVITY! (Although it is evil and squishying my spine...) How can you remain apathatic at a time like this!? The fate of mankind has been forever altered! Oh. Yeah...I guess you are right. I AM just rambling so that this Longest Text Ever gets even longer. But I DO care about this topic. There's not even a conspiracy! Well..fine! Be that way! Goodbye! I'm back *twitch* and seriously annoyed. Grrr...time to yet again complain about my *twitch* evil family. It is once again the time of year that makes entire families bond together...in the same sense that cats and dogs bond together when they have rabies. The time...is science fair time. My younger, eviler sister does a science project every single year. *twitch* The concept of science projects strikes fear in my mother's heart. She can not stand them. Naturally, this is why she takes over the project and does it for my little sister. Unfortunatly, this means that I am often called on for my "consultant" abilities. *twitch* In other words, I do the experiment, and think of all the results, and the wording of everything. I then interpret my work for my mother, who writes everything down because she has really, really obsessivly neat handwritting. Of course, my mother gets stressed merely handling paper that will potentionally be USED for a science project, so this is a very, very negative situation. Oh, and my mother refuses to even entertain the notion that my little sister might possibly be of help *twitch*. At this very moment my little sister is watching a Disney movie, while complaining of a headache. *twitch* My mother is getting more and more aggravated as I try to explain that my sister might fail if it looks like she didn't do the project. I am currently on strike. I refuse to assist this project in any further way untill my little sister does freakin' SOMETHING. Wow. Speak of the devil. My sister IS doing something. She is RE-WRITING everything my mother just wrote. Like mother like daughter. *twitch* I guess this is my mother's way to make sure the judges don't know that my sister didn't do the project. My mother makes my sister redo everything over and over again because it's not perfect enough for her. Now she is the one who's getting yelled at. I guess I can't help but feel sorry for my evil sister. *pauses* I guess I'll stop complaining, then. God...I have a headache...seeya. I'm back. *shakes head* And I have (yet again) a rant about the sheer weirdness of my family. Previously I have ranted about our fun-filled family outing to a bar, and about my non-gender specific siblings obsession with dead animals. Somehow, these two occurances have joined in an unholy union to create: The Roadkill Sightseeing Event of Doom! We actually went to a normal resteraunt for dinner, believe it or not. On the way back, my mother entertained us with the story of how she had seen roadkill that looked exactly like a dead bear. She had later compared notes with one of her wacko friends and they had decided that it was, in fact, a dead wild boar. We would be passing by it in a few minutes. Oh joy. My non-gender specific sibling (henceforth known as my sister) was naturally estatic about these events. She wanted to get out and see the boar. My mother agreed, and wanted my Dad to turn the car around so we could go to Wal-Mart to buy a flash-light. My father refused this. We ended up driving right past the supposed location of the boar, much to the dismay of my sister and mother...and dare I say it? Yes...I dare. My BROTHER was even interested. Faced with direct mutiny from all but me, my father wisely elected to turn the car around. We drove off the road and my dad aimed the car headlights at the boar. I must say, it wasn't that impressive. It was just a lump of black hair, and it was a lot smaller than any bear. My sister was impressed, and it was all I could do to keep her from jumping out of the car to it. My mother was disappointed, saying that the boar had seemed bigger in the daylight. My dad moved the car back and forth, so that we could see the boar on the side of the road more clearly. My mother became terrified and decided that we would flip and die. All to see a boar. After a few minutes, we drove away. My mother seemed upset that I had not been interested in her roadkill. I can't help but feel cheated. Normal families go to museums and theme parks for amusement. We view dead animals. There is something just SLIGHTLY wrong with this. It reminds me of the time a few weeks ago when my mother swore up and down that she saw a grave by the side of the road. This bothered her for some time untill one day she finally pulled over to the side of the road and exhumed the shallow grave and discovered that it was actually a deer. Luckily, I was not with her this day. However, she never leaves any member of our family in the dark concerning roadkill. It's just strange. Anyway, that's the rant for today, seeying as how there was actually a topic. Seeya! I'm back! Seeing how I will shortly no longer be (legally) a child, I have decided to rant about: adults. You cannot deny it. They are EVIL. Think about it! Come, on! Don't be shy! I'm serious. When you think of the evil, conniving, conspiratorial ways of adults, what's the first thing to come to mind? The nursery rhyme, 'Mary Had a Little Lamb', right? Huh? You mean it's NOT!? How...bizzare, it's obviously a mechanism for brain-washing. Anyway, here's MY reasoning for hating the song (and many, many others). Mary Had A Little Lamb makes children resigned to accepting punishment that they don't deserve! You still do not see!? Fine, I shall elaborate. This poor little girl's lamb (with fleece as white as snow--an obvious reference to seeming purity) follows her to school one day (which was, oddly enough, against the rules). The kids at school, who were not used to seeing a lamb at school, started to "laugh and play" and basically act like wild animals. Now (this is all speculation) I am 90% sure that the final verse (which neither I, nor anyone I asked know) deals with the teacher reprimanding poor little Mary in some way. And for what!? The kid's pet followed her to school! How could she stop it, she probably never even thought to look behind her! Not only that, but poor little Mary would never, EVER do such a thing on purpose! Just listen to the SONG for cryin' out loud! The lamb followed HER! She didn't LEAD it! Now, sure, the teacher was probably on her last nerve. I mean, she's an ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER. She probably doesn't get paid much, or gain much respect from her pupils. So, when the children pretty much went wild over the lamb, and she couldn't calm them, she was looking for someone to blame. And poor little Mary was a ripe target by then. Now, can you honestly picture poor little Mary arguing with her teacher? I didn't think so! Little Mary took her punishment, and her PARENTS were probably so upset that they got rid of her white little lamb. And for what!? A teacher's misbegotten pride? Adult supremecy? I ask you, knowing what you know now, could you (in good faith) read this to a young child (implicitly teaching them that it's best not to argue, to simply lie down and let those older than you walk all over you--for "your own good")? And another thing! You know the lullaby, 'Rock A'Bye Baby', the one about the baby in the tree!? What kind of SICKO wrote it!? This poor baby is up in a tree (not the safest of places) in the middle of a freakin' HURICANE! At the end of the freakin' song, the freakin' BRANCH BREAKS and the baby falls, "cradel and all" (presumably to its death). What about Hanzel and Gretel? It's nothing more than a huge threat! "Now, be good or we'll send you out into the woods to be eaten by the witch." What kind of twisted person does that to children? Ring Around the Rosy? It's a song about the Black Plague, the deadliest plague in mankind's history! When you first got it, you'd get a red spot with a ring around it (Ring around the rosy). During this time, people (mistakenly) thought that stench spread sickeness, so they'd keep "pockets full of posies" to ward of the stench of death around them. "Ashes, Ashes" was originall "Achoo-Achoo", because the dying would be particularly susceptable to colds. "We all fall down"? That's an easy one. We fall down dead. So, it's obvious that adults don't exactly sugar-coat everything they teach to children. I'm sure I can find more horribly EVIL examples, but I simply don't have the time. Now, granted, there are SOME (but not many) children's stories that are beneficial. Like Snow White, or Cinderlla. Those stories teach children to think for themselves, and occasionally completly ignore the adults around them (as long as they are Evil Step-Parents). Well...I'd better go. *blinks* I wrote a lot today. I suppose I should write other stuff...but...well...I figure you need the break to recover your sanity...*snort* Like you could do THAT! Seeya! I'm back! As I am writing this, I am in the process of adding a navigation bar to the Longest Text Ever. It still is as chaotic as ever, but at least this way people can find certain stuff easier. Like the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony info. Anyway, that's about all I have to say right now. Seeya! Gah! Fellow Flaming-Chickens, you must see the sheer cool paranoid thinking I have found! Wal-Mart is EVIL! A person (besides me) thinks this! Isn't that cool!? There is even a section on Wal-Mart Subliminal T.V. (tupperware, anyone?)! Anyway, this has been a short public service annoucement. As opposed to one of those long public service announcments that keep on going and going and going. I mean, they just never seem to stop, do they? Just when you think they are finally going to run out of steam, they just charge on and on. It's like torture, or something. Don't those kind of people realize that if they public REALLY cared about the topic, they'd do their own durn research, instead of listening to some self-important moron lecture them about how socially-irresponsible they are? Not that I'm trying to prove a point. Quite the contrary: I am merely extending the lenght of this Longest Text Ever to provide an ironic example of self-important morons who just won't stop talking. Isn't it entertaining? Don't you just want to here my entire life's story, starting from age 2? You don't? Well...perhaps I really SHOULD leave...what do you think? Er...well...seeya! Yep. I'm back. *traumatic pause* This weekend I went to go visit my future college. It was the most traumatizing experience of my life, to date. The day before I got there the college had won a basketball game and were going to the finals. This naturally caused parties to break out all over campus. According to one guy, a couch was "set on fire". *sigh* I was "hosted" (along with two other girls) by some bubbly, perky Greek (sorority (sp?)) girl. I hate her so much. She never shut up. She was so shallow. She wanted us to join a sorority, just like her. (all paraphrased) Ex. 1 "I would NEVER have passed my classes if I hadn't gone Greek". Ex. 2 "I just don't see HOW I would have, like, ya' know, managed ANYTHING without my sisters!" If I never see her again it will be too soon. Her idea of entertainment was to take us to the recreational center, sit us down in the gym and talk to her friends while watching the guys (badly, this IS an engineering school after all) attempt to play basketball. Apparantly all the decent players were at the final game thingy. Then she took us to the fraternity next to her house (we didn't even get to "experience" sleeping in an actual dorm). The fraternity was disgusting. There must have been 1000 flies, 100 beer bottles, 50 Bud Lite cans, and 5 creepy dudes who were attempting to practice music for some competition. After about three hours of this, I almost snapped. Me and another girl were supposed to be watching T.V., but due to the evil, out of tune, incredibly loud band, this proved to be impossible. My "host" and the girl who was enthusiastic about "going Greek" were swimming in a heated pool. The other girl (who also hated to swimn) and I started to talk. There was nothing else really to do. She hated our host and hated the fraternity/Greek thing too. We talked for awhile, and some dude joined us. He was cool. He was regional STAR student for another area. Somehow we got onto the topic of religion, and it turned out that the other girl I was with was Muslim, and was born in Egypt. It was cool. Anyway, it was just the two of us girls in the entire FREAKIN' fraternity (not counting the two swiming girls, downstairs. The floor was greasy, and oddly sticky--just like a movie theater. When our "host" finnally said we could go, it was close to 2 a.m. I barely got any sleep...grrr...not to mention the fact that we had walk to breakfast by 8:00 a.m. Oh. Silly me. I forgot to mention a key difficulty. We had to WALK EVERYWHERE! Uphill! (But not in the freezing snow, for 15 miles). You have not experinced Jenny's personal Hell untill you have carried your luggage (including a trash bag containing a sleeping back and the trash bags plastic handley-thingies are rapidly stretching out to become lethal weapons similar to piano wire) uphill, upstairs, across campus and up the four or five flights to the breakfast area, only to discover that, Oh! Gee, there was an ELEVATOR that the "host" conviently forgot to mention. Even more evil stuff happened, but suffice it to say that when I finally saw my dad at lunch, I begged him to just skip the final sessions because they were pointless (how to choose your major) and go home. He went ahead with his sessions, but let me opt out of mine and I slept for 50 minutes on some random couch in the lobby. Oh. And then the 6 hour drive home. *shudders* As you can tell, I am still seriously miffed about the whole experience. Sorry for ranting... Well...there WAS some good things about the whole experience. For one thing, it was the first time I'd ever been in a big city. The sky line was beautiful! Er...yeah...that was about it. Did I mention the uphill walking part? I did? Oh. Well. Then. I guess I'm done. Seeya! I'm back! And I'm here with a Vital Public Service Anouncment for all of my two and a half Loyal, Hypothetical Readers! Don't you feel all special inside? Oh. Yeah. The anouncment. BEWARE OF YOUR OWN FRENCH FRIES. That's correct. French fries. You see, it all started one friday afternoon *start wavy flashback sequence* My friends and I were sitting down to a tasty lunch of Skool Brand food. This included, tragically, french fries. Oh, what a fateful day. It seems like it was only yesterday when we were so carefree and innocent...when in fact it was actually only a few hours ago. You see, we inadvertantly started a mini-food fight that spilled over into a neighboring table, which also housed our friends. Said friends began flingning the aformentioned French Fries at us. I shudder to think of how we had laughed and frolicked and otherwise remained oblivious to the tragedy that had yet to unfold. For, you see...the french fires were...pointy...and hard. And Fate herself seemed to conspire against us (just like the Skool, government, evil cartoon owl, etc.) One single solitary french fry pierced my friend's guard and hit her on the nose with the sharpest, hardest tip a french fry has ever been known to produce. We calmed down, and thought nothing of our near brush with Death. After all, what can a FREAKIN' FRENCH FRY do, right? Ahhh...to be so young and naive again. Time passed, as it always does, and "Meg" noticed a speck of something on our friend who had been hit by the projectile french fry. The friend (Tonileigh, actually) wiped the speck, only to discover that it was blood. THE FRENCH FRY HAD DRAWN BLOOD! It was obviously an evil, voodoo french fry sent to assasinate her by the mysteriously evil Cafeteria Lunch Ladies who needed Tonileigh's blood for their accursed voodoo spells. Fortunatly, the quick thinking of "Meg" saved us all and the lunch ladies never obtained their goal. Oh. And here is yet ANOTHER VERY, VERY, VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICE THINGY. Tag, you're it! These words have haunted nearly ever playground in existance. "Tag" is practically all a child learns in kindergarten. There is not a person alive who has not played some version of the game. And yet...what, exactly is "it"? When defining it for my Pronoun Quiz I reffered to "it" as something that "mankind has dreaded for centuries". What made me say such a thing. What is it about the unknown, mysterious and faintly ominous "it" that makes people dread it so much? Even the most innocent of children know that to be "it" is to be a virtual outcast of society. The youngest child knows that no sane person would want to be "it". Recently a group of TAB members, myself included, set about finding out what "it" exactly is. We conducted "field research" (we played a game of tag). When I became "it" I declared that I was touching the bench I was standing on so it became "it" and the bench was touching the ground, and the ground was touching everything on earth, except for airplanes and stuff but even the ground was touching AIR which was touching more air and so on and so on untill the very AIR was touching the airplanes and the airplanes became "it". So...the entire earth has actually been "it" from the first game of tag and WE JUST NEVER KNEW IT! I know, I'm just as shocked as you, Hypothetical Reader. *shakes head* And all along we had thought that we could somehow absolve ourselves of the burden of being "it" simply by passing it on to another. But that is not true. We merely pass the awareness of being "it" on but never the actual quality of being "it". The question was raised: Where did the first "it" on Earth come from. It was a thought provoking question. Some thought that perhaps the first person to invent tag was the original "it". I, however, favored an extraterristrial origin. My current theory is that the meteor that supposidly killed off the dinosaurs was the original "it", and that it "tagged" the earth, thereby causeing the earth to be "it". The dinosaurs, of course, could not handle the burden of being "it" which resulted in mass suicides. The mammals, being nothing but idiot rodents at the time, couldn't care less about being "it" and eventually forgot all about it. Until, that is, some half-remembered special memory popped out of some five year old's brain and he/she invented tag. Some people found holes in my theory: How did the meteor become "it"? After much discussion and deliberation, we came to a group consensus that the so called "Big Bang" was actually all the players of the game scattering. Similar to the beggining of a game of tag or hide-n-go-seek. The players begin huddled together, but when the game starts they scatter and flee from the person/planet/rock who is "it". The only difference I can think of is that rather than passing the "it"ness on, the players merely add to the number of people who are already "it". My theory would also account for the current scientific opinion that the planets/galaxy/universe is moving away from the origin point of the Big Bang. After all, if there's no base, why return to where you started? You wanna put as much distance between you and your pursuers as possible. Critics wanted to go further, was anyone "it" BEFORE the Big Bang. My arguement is this: No one is "it" before you begin a game. Any "it" before the Big Bang was part a seperate game, and would therefore be considered a different "it" from the "it" that we fear so much. So I believe the question to be a moot point. *blinks* What's that, Loyal Reader? I have confused you with my trivalties? You do not understand my obsession with "it"? Shame on you, Reader! Haven't you learned yet that it's my JOB to confuse you and make no sense? Tsk-Tsk. Oh, well. Gotta go! I'm back, but only for about five seconds. Just a little side note here: Remember that rant I did about "pure" water? (don't even get me started) In it I mentioned that fast-food salt lists its ingredients, right? Well, here they are! *takes package of Burger King Iodized Salt out of pocket* Drumroll please...and the ingredients are: salt, sodium silico aluminate, dextrose, and 0.01% potassium iodide. Wasn't that painstakenly accurate? A hundreth of a percente of the salt was potassium iodide! You can't get much more accurate than that. Don't you think that "pure" water has much MORE than 0.01% of some random mineral? Why don't THEY list it, huh? *shakes head* *mutters* Evil, "pure" water companies... *wanders off muttering to self and acting like a crazy hobo* Seeya... I'm back! And I have yet another footnote to a previous rant! You remember that "infinite possibilities" rant? Here's a quote from a supposed Time Traveler: "Every possible thing that can happen or will happen has already happened somewhere." I love it! Here's another one: "On a philosophical level, the existence of multiple worlds implies a moral balance in the superverse. For every worldline you perform a good action, there is a worldline where you perform a bad action. There are no good and bad people, just good and bad decisions. We can only be responsible for what we do as individuals on the worldline we are on now. " These are all exactly what I've been thinking of when I first came up with my infinite universe thingy to tell my little brother when he was bored and wanted his head to explode! Seeya! I'm back. And I just wanted to say that I went to Islands of Adventure (in Universal Studios) yesterday. It was incredible! If you wanna here about the awesome rides, (esp. the Spiderman ride, best 3-d effects and vitual reality I've EVER seen...) just click here. *shrugs* This way, if you don't wanna here me rant about it, you can here some guy PAID to rant about it rant about. But if you don't want to, you don't got to. Seeya! I'm back! Wow...*shakes head* My mother never ceases to be amusing. Since today IS mother's day, I shall devot this text to her...even if it is a bit of satire or whatever. You see...my mother has found a new "religion". She is reading some book written by some bimbo who has been to "the other side" and conversed with her "spirt guardian" or whatever and decided to share her "relevations" with people willing to pay a lot of money for garbage. At least...that's my opinion of it. My mother, however, takes it all VERY seriously. For instance, today at our (almost normal) dinner out she instructed me on the way to get to heaven. It involved opening a door. Seriously. Anyway...apparantly once you perish in this realm you are taken to a set of doors. The door on the right leads directly to heaven (do not pass "Go" do not collect $200). The door on the left "zaps you into someone's uterus" which, loosely translated, means that you get reincarnated. This is the "bad" choice. I know this because my sister expressed an intrest in being reincarnated and my mother looked at her with an expression of horror and said solemnly that if she did that "God would never forgive" her. She then proceded to tell us that if you were reincarnated you had to live out multiple lives until you were ready for heaven. *shakes head* Maybe I'm missing something, but if "God would never forgive" someone who innocently chose the wrong freakin' door, wouldn't that indicate that such a person would be barred from heaven forever? Isn't there just the SLIGHTEST bit of inconsistancy here? Why would somebody get punished by randomly choosing the wrong (apparantly unlabeled) door? Look. I don't mean to offend...~.< If you happen to be part of this religion (which prophecies Elvis's return sometime this year (2004) as "a blond hair, blue-eyed boy") then that's your choice. I definitly don't want to get in any theological debates here. So...I'll move on the a relatively safer topic. The National Enquirer. They're obsessed with Elvis, too, for some reason. I just don't understand why people care. I mean, Elvis is always reported as being: abducted by aliens, frozen in a tube in Area 51, having a brain transplant and is now the Pop-Star Britney Spears, and stuff like that. One song I've heard even equates Elvis with Jesus, for cryin' out loud! ("You're no Jesus, You're no Elvis" (From Megolomaniac, by some band). Why do people obsess over that poor, most likely dead, man? The world may never know. ( And don't even get me started on Tootsie Roll Pops). Anyway, I guess my point is that the book my mom is reading has a similar dedication to accuracty, hard-hitting facts and common sense as the famed National Enquirer (which confidently predicted several months ago that Michael Jackson's "secret Muslim bride" would exonerate all charges of child molestation against him. Which, in case you live on the moon, has NOT happened and probably never will). Anyhoo, that's my rant for the day...I'll probably post something in l33t eventually...seeya! I am back. (REAL introduction: Heh-Heh…I had ANOTHER sugar rush. And I was just a little bit hysterical. The following is my intro I wrote while sugar rushed, and various messages I sent to people while in the same state. Don’t worry if you can’t understand it…you aren’t supposed to. *sigh* The whole thing is just a blur of those wiggly red lines spell-check uses to tell you that stuff is spelled wrong…) I back! hee-hee! here is ANother sugar coated rant! and I am typing the intro while still hyper/slepepy. you see, i drank Sobe energy drink, a cup of sugar (just sugar) and ate cake (yet agina, late at night). So this was the result in various messages I left random peolple.
*giigleing * Heee0-Heeeee!

It's just that sugar under the wright surcumstances is doin' stuff...
Okay. Is done. Mike the Headlessc hickrn day is coming up! seeya later! I'm back. It has been a year since the Evil Graduation Post. Which means that this year I got to attend my OWN graduation. Woo. I must say that I was rather underwhelemed by the whole thing. *shrugs* Sure, the fireworks were spectacular...and there was BEAUTIFUL weather. Cool, (not sufficatingly hot) absolutly no gnats for the first time in YEARS, no rain, just nice, soothing speeches that made absolulty no sense. At one point, our priniciple yelled at the graduating class because we weren't listening to him. The audience (consisting of parents) booed at him. So the principal yells at the PARENTS! What was he THINKING!? It's a good thing he's leaving, soon, because otherwise he'd probably been fired. Anyway, I just wanted to warn you of the dangers of broccolii: It's a form of lichen/moss that grows abundantly on certain sectors of Mars. In recent years, it has been cultivated by farmers into a semi-toxic product meant to augment the on-going brain-washing of young children, with the sole purpose being to turn them into Young Adults. Seeya! I'm back. I'm just gonna be here for a little while *demonstrates with fingers* so you don't have to worry 'bout crazy, paranoid rants. I just wanted to mention that former President Reagan apparantly declared ketchup to be a vegetable. Isn't that GREAT! I love ketchup so much...I don't even like FRIES...I eat 'em 'cause they are a means to convey KETCHUP to my mouth...mmmm....ketchup. Oh. Poor, poor Reagan ( he died last week...) Hasta Luego (means seeya later) I'm back. *sigh* This dang chatterbot is taking up WAY too much of my time! There's constantly things that needed fixing, updating and improving! Bah! But, I'm obsessed, and I've always been interested in simulated artificial intelligence :) Anyway, I'm making her personality really paranoid (she's based on me). Here are her thoughts concerning cows: *glances around* Just between you and me: I think there is some sort of dairy conspiracy! Ah, the power of cheese! Think about it: they are trying to sub-consciously tell you that THEY hold the power...of CHEEESE! And there are few things more powerful than THAT! Plus, the so-called "dairy farmer's of America" who pay for the Cheese commercials OBVIOUSLY have a virtual monopoly on the whole dairy thing. They even require that cheese get that little "real cheese" stamp before anyone considers it to be REAL cheese. Have you ever tasted fake cheese? Anyway, my point is that it is getting increasingly harder to find the time to make new quizzes, (or add pics to that destiny quiz), and to make coherent entries into this longest text ever. *sniffle* I try, though! It's just that it's so FUN to teach PSOPC bot subtle things, that maybe one in every 1000 visitor will stumble on to! Like, when she accuses you of being on of THEM, and you say "yes" she starts to panic, and won't listen to you unless you say somthing to get her attention. Ahhhhhhh. Well, anyway, enough about my little obsession. No sense in boring you all with the little technicall details (frankly, pandorabots has the training interface done really well...there is almost no need to know ANYTHING about programming...which, frankly...I don't...^^;;) Er....I guess that's all I have to say now...I don't really have much more parnoid conspiracies or strange observations to make. Er...I guess I could discuss something that has already become obsolete. Have you ever been to subway? You have, *nods* yeah...I love that place, too. Anywaaaays, I went there once and I noticed a poster in the window. It showed people of every size, shape and color, all of them in little pics in little neat boxes. The text read: Different People Differnt Tastes. Okay. I could easily see what it was TRYING to say: There is something for EVERYONE at Subway (eat fresh). But my very first thought was: Whoa, hey, are they CANNIBALS!? Because I interpretted it to mean that different people TASTED differnt, and that's what the subs were made out of and why there was such a great variety. Er...I know, Hypothetical Reader...not the best example of my eccentric thought proccess...but it's the first one that came to mind. *sigh* You know, come to think of it, I bet I HAVE dwindled back down to two and half readers (if that). After all...look how LONG this thing is getting! And, well, quite frankly, people are mostly contacting me about PSOPC bot, the OFCEM or the Quizzes, and *sniffle* mostly ignoring this little (note the irony) page. Well, seey later! I'm back. And, for the first time in quite some time, I am truly pissed off...and this is the only way I can vent my anger. Gah! Well, I suppose you'll need to know some back story, huh. (WARNING: CONTENTS OF THIS PASSAGE MAY CONTAIN DANGEROUSLY LOW LEVELS OF HUMOR, IRONY AND SARCASM. READING THIS PASSAGE MAY CAUSE THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS: LACK OF INTEREST, BOREDOM AND A GENERAL SENSE THAT THIS IS NOT LIKE NORMAL RANTS ABOUT PARANOIA, STRANGE OBSERVATIONS AND FAMILY QUIRKS) To begin with, I JUST got a job as a cashier slave at K-Mart. NEVERMIND the fact that I've worked at the daycare for A WHOLE YEAR, just so I wouldn't have to work for my final Summer of Freedom. Apparantly, my dad does not want me to actually USE any of the money I made from my previous job to buy college supplies. Instead, he wants me to learn the horrors of minimum wage employment and induce me to to strive to succede in the college world. NEVERMIND the fact that my previous job gave me LESS money...I apparantly STILL need to understand that there is more to life than $5.50 an hour. GAH! I KNEW that most jobs sucked unless you had a degree (and even then, most STILL sucked)! Why bother to teach me THE SAME FREAKIN' LESSON AGAIN!? Eh. I didn't argue, mostly 'cause my dad IS paying for most of the college expenses...so I am grateful. I just hate K-Mart. So...today was my biggest shift ever, from 3 pm to 8 pm. It's the latest I've ever worked, too. I know it's NOTHING compared to a full time job...but it's still enough to make me snap. FIRST OF ALL...well...there weren't a lot of customers during the first half of my shift. Blessing, or horrible boredom? In either case, I managed to obtain a Bag of Air from a purse someone bought, and (true to form) instead of discarding said air bag, I drew a face on it and decided that it was my pet, Bag. Oh, me and Bag had great times. I taught Bag how to return (I threw him at a fan and he blew into my face). I introduced Bag to a customer I knew (after they left and I was alone, even I knew that talking to a Bag is weird). *sigh* I hugged and squeezed Bag harder than I have ever squeezed a Moose, because I knew that Bag didn't have stuff like organs. The worst that could have happened that he would have exploded in my face, blinding me forever. Ahhhhh...Bag. Then...*sniffle* tragedy struck. I left my register to get something to restock the candy...and when I came back...Bag was missing! Frantic, I looked around, and saw, before my very eyes, a fellow cashier puncture my precious Bag with a key! They had thought that Bag was garbage! I had customers and so I had to deal with them, with a false smile plastered painfully on my face, while all the while I was repeating over and over the horrible scene. Once the customers left (after what seemed like an eternity) I rushed over to wear I had seen Bag. He wasn't there. I looked in the garbage can...he wasn't there. I looked in some nearby boxes...he wasn't there. I couldn't ASK the other cashier what she had done with Bag...no one at K-Mart knows my true weird nature yet. So...I regretfully had to forego giving Bag his needed funeral respects. We had some good times together...and we had JUST started to bond when his life was ended. I knew that it would happen, eventually. Even if I had managed to bring him home, I would eventually have lost interest. Bag was the perfect companion for my boring hour and a half. But Bag was no more. As the time dragged on, more and more customers came. During the last hour, the customers started to dwindle off (cool word, huh...dwindle...say it! Dwiiiiiindle...) I was once again left bored. I eventually grabbed a piece of cardboard (hmmmm...that came discarded from a bag I sold, too...coincidence? I think not!) and started to draw a cute little bunny and a tiger...(GAH! I think I left that at the register...I bet that EVIL other cashier is throwing it away, right NOW!). I was able to draw in peace for a while, with only the most minor of customer interruptions. Then...the other Cashier went on her brake. We are allowed 15 minutes for our breaks. She went 17 minutes before I my shift was over. Can you guess what happened? *sigh* I HAD been planning to close up shop at about 7:53 and clock out on TIME for once ( I usually close when I'm supposed to leave and end up clocking out 5 minutes after). So...I am looking forward to doing a little shopping (for hand-held Nerf guns) before my parental unit came to pick me up. So, predict, if you will, what happend exactly 10 mintues before I was going to close. You can't? Well...let me tell you: EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE STORE APPARANTLY DECIDED THAT IT WAS TIME FOR THEM TO LEAVE. Not all at once, oh, no, they were more subtle than that. At first, all I felt was mild annoyance. I even thought, oh, I guess I won't finish my pic. Then, ten more people were in the line. I thought about asking the last person to prevent more people from entering, but I though, Hey, why bother? It's not as if there can be many more people in the store, right? Wrong. As I widdled (another cool word) my way through the customers, MORE KEPT COMING. After barely having any ALL DAY, all of them swarmed like a hive of malevolent bees. GRRRRRR... This time I DID ask the last person to keep others out. Everyone seemed to be amused. I was the only cashier, where would other people go? I explained that they could check out at the service deck, which was an exhausting 25 ft away (I was more polite though). Finnally. It was 8:05 and I was on my last customer. I was irratated that I wouldn't have enough time to get the Nerf gun, but other than that I was just eager to get home. Ahhh...those last customers. I think they were sent just to try my patience. First of all, they bought a few expensive items. They gave me a gift card, and they still had $59 left to pay. They tried to pay with credit, but it turned out they didn't have enough dough in their account to pay. So, they wrote me a check for half the ammount, and then tried to pay the rest with credit. The credit machine froze. After fiddling with it for a few minutes, I walked those hazardous 25ft to the service desk to ask for assistance. I waited while the person delt with a customer. I heard someone call my name. MY customers were frantically gestering to me. So I walked back. It seems that they had overestimated their credit account. BUT, their boyfriends showed up and gave them 5 bucks, so they gave THAT to me and then paid the rest with credit. They left, I closed up. I shut my register off at 8:20 pm. I glanced outside and saw my parental waiting on me. I angrily stalked all the way to the back, and clocked out. Then I stalked back and got in the car, at 8:30pm. I was furious. I had suppressed ALL emotions while actually working, but as soon as I stepped away from that register my dam broke and I was awash in them. Gah! Suppression of self (my technique for dealing with any situation involving strangers) just applified my anger by suppressing it. By the time I got home, all I wanted to do was mutilate and slaughter helpless animals on my favorite video game (supposidly, the point of the game is to save the world, but I just like shooting the life like animals). Of course, when I got to the PS2...the game was not there. I had left it in my OLD PS2 that I had taken with me on my vacation. The PS2 is in a box, right next to me at this very moment. The game is inside it. I COULD plug it in and obtain the game...but by now I have mostly excorized my emotions by reliving them by adding to this Longest Text Ever. I KNOW it was a petty thing to get angry about...but I didn't want to job to begin with. (And poor, poor Bag...) I never WANTED a job where you might not get off on time...like my friends always complained about McDonalds. Like them, if there are still customers...I can't leave! To make matters worse, it doesn't even feel as if I am working for money, since all I earn goes in a bank account for my future use. I am present oriented! I don't care about some hypothetical future! It's as if I am working for the sole purpose of making my dad happy. Eh...well...enough whining from me... Seeya. Hiya! And I have a GREAT conspiracy/paranoid rant! Don't you just feel all warm and gooey inside, like melted cheese? Suprisingly enough, this is the topic of today's rant: cheese. Mmmmmmmm...cheese. Mild Cheddar, Mozzerella, Feta, Montery Jack, Colby...Mmmmm...or what about that Queso Blanco they use in Mexican resteraunts? Mmmmm... I love cheese, and chances are: You love it, too. There are even commercials, just for cheese. Not even a particular BRAND of cheese, just the entire CONCEPT of cheese. "Ahhhh, the power of cheese!" And I couldn't agree more. But...it HAS come to my attention somehow or another that this is and EVIL arrangement. Think about it for one moment. Have you EVER seen a commercial urging you to buy, for instance, burgers? Just burgers. In general. No mention of McDonald's or Wendy's, or those frozen Bubba Burgers. Just...ya' know, the CONCEPT of burgers? How about pain medication? Bannanas? Milk? Ah! There we go. Milk. Just about EVERYONE has seen those GOT MILK? commercials. Every school in my county has a cafeteria chock FULL of posters of celebraties with milk mustaches, with the logo: GOT MILK? Hmmmmm...sooooooooo...just WHAT do CHEESE and MILK have in common? Let's see...BOTH are owned by the United Dairy Farmers of America. Hmmm...and it seems that OTHER countries have similar such organizations. In fact, there is even a CHICKEN Farmers organization (although apparantly it is not United). But other food stuffs organizations just don't seem to be as active as these mysterious dairy farmers. Hmmmm... Why bother to advertise a product, without bothering to promote a single company or brand name? Wouldn't you think that the companies could handle the advertising themselves? I know Kraft does: *sing*K-R-A-F-T. And lots of companies harp on the ammount of calcium in cheese. Sooo..why do the FARMERS advertise milk and cheese? Is it all a vast conspiracy? After all, this mysterious, spooky organization owns ALL THE CHEESE. Shocking, isn't it? So, this complete monopoly of the cheese world controls virtually all prices for all cheese/dairy items, including: Cheese Pizza, Ice Cream, Milk, Cheese, CheeseBurgers, Tacos, Cheesy Bread, Cheese Doritos, Nacho Cheese, Butter, Etc. (Etc. is not actually a dairy product, consisitng mostly of an ecletic mix of random items, but I figured that it would work to show the continuing theme of dairy type items. ) Why does the government allow such a monopoly to exist? Are they FUNDED by the government? Let's see *does a google search* Ooooo! Pay Dirt! I'm not the only one to see the evils of Got Milk! THIS SITE has an arcticle about the anger of small dairy farmers for the monopoly of the "Got Milk?" people. Jeff Manning, Executive Director of the California Milk Processor Board is apparantly in charge of this. What a strange title. Hmmmm...*scans the article* Oooo! They notice the non-brand-specific advertising! And it says how they are funded: "So-called “generic” advertising programs such as “Got Milk?” and “Ahh, the power of cheese” are funded, in part, through the congressionally authorized dairy checkoff, which places a mandatory assessment of 15 cents per hundredweight (roughly two cents per gallon) on all milk domestically produced and marketed commercially. Last year, the dairy checkoff raked in more than $250 million in hard-earned dairy producer money. " Soooo in essence, they ARE funded by the government (or at least in the sense that the government STEALS the small dairy farmer's money to pay for the ads). And they were sued by a small farmer who said: "We’re against having to fork over a huge portion of our bottom line for advertising that says all milk is equal." So they don't WANT to pay for the ads, but the government (and that California Dairy thingy) say they have to. Ha! That's hilarious! These stupid Dairy Conglomorate people are actually PAYING a town to rename itself "Got Milk" with those small dairy farmer's money! That's so pointless! It's like they are having these HUGE brain-storming sessions to see how they can best squander those small dairy people's money! "Hmmmm...Bob, why don't we buy all those "Largest Block of Cheese" roadside attractions and make a monument with them, entitled 'Ahhh, the power of cheese!'?" "Brilliant, Ted! But, I'd like to go one step further! Let's make an entire CITY out of cheese!" "Bob, that's it! Wait...wait! I think I GOT IT! Let's BUY a CITY the idiot yokels to CHANGE THEIR NAME TO GOT MILK! That way, we can still have those cheese ideas to fall back on afterwards!" *shakes head* It's so pathetic. *does happy dance* See, here I was ranting and raving about this, and it turns out that there already ARE people outraged! It's like that rant about the smoke detectors, and later I saw a movie about spy cameras in them. Or that Grape Pie Rant that ended up with me doing a google search months later (When I was bored) and discovering a pic of it...mmmm....grape pie. It's incredible how many strange things I can get outraged about, only to discover that they aren't strange at all! Well...seeya! Wootage! I'm back! And I have a new rant about the evils of parental brain-washing during childhood. Consider it a combo of the "Tag" rant and the "Mary Had a Little Lamb" rant. *shudders* How could I have missed such obvious implecations!? Gah! I shall focus! Alright...the subject of today's whatchamacallit is: Duck, Duck, Goose! It is EVIL! Now, I KNOW that most of what small children learn is actually not-so-cleveraly disguised brain-washing attempts, but this is just plain wrong! For those of you not familiar with the game, let me summarize. One child is "it" (JUST like in Tag). This child, labels each of the children, usually as "duck". The other children are sitting in a circle, and the "it" child walks around tapping their heads, going: "Duck, Duck, Duck"... Simple enough, right? Ah, but THEN the "it" child picks somebody ELSE to be "it", and tap the unfortunate victim on the head, crying "Goose!". Then the "goose" must pursue the "it" one and attempt to tag them. If they do not tag the "it" child, the "goose" becomes "it". If they succede in tagging them, the "it" child goes in the "mush pot" and the "goose" becomes "it" anyway. Alright. Now you know what the game IS...let's move onto what it MEANS. First of all, the game is CLEARLY a mock witch hunt. The children alienate and ostracize the one who is different, the one who is a "goose" when everyone else are "ducks". The "it" child is the current pariah, and obviously wants to exchange situations with a more fortunate child. So, the "it" child desperatly accuses another of being a "goose" (just as condemned witches accused others of witchcraft in order to alleviate their sentence). The child, symbolically shocked and appaled by such wild accusations, denies it, and even goes so far as to pursue the accusing pariah. If the accusation is deemed false (i.e. the "goose" tags the "it") then the accusing "it" child is sent to exile (the mush pot). HOWEVER, the taint of suspicion is already upon the former "goose" and despite protestations to the contrary, the child is the new "it" pariah. And the game continues. This game is DESIGNED to teach children how to shun those who are different, and to ostracize them from society if neccessary! How can this POSSIBLY be one of those little life's lessons that children must learn to become Responsible Adults? *shakes head in disgust* Well, anyway, that's it for today! Seeya! I'm back! *giggles wildly* Woot! I have something EXTRA SPECIAL for you loyal readers *cricket chirps yet again...what is UP with that?*! "Meg", the inspiration to that Pointless Signs of America Rant, has "agreed" to do a rant for us! It's GREAT! *giggles* Well, here it is: "Meg" here. Jenny has kindly asked aka threatened me to do a guest rant, and I am only too happy to oblige. So here I am ready to inform you of silly things! Let's start! Go! Go! It has come to my attention that Barbie has finally found a new love. That's right. Bye-bye to boring Ken! Here comes Australian surfer Blaine! At this point, a few of you will be screaming: "No! Ken and Barbie forevaaaaa!" An insane percentage of you will be going: "Oh, that is so cute, Barbie and Blaine! That's great cause, like, both of their names start with B! Heehee!" But most of you will be wondering if that leftover pizza a week ago that is still in the fridge is eatable. Trust me on this, it's not. So why am I bringing this up? How many of you remember playing with Barbies? (The guys reading this.pretend it's G.I. Joe and his buddies.) Remember when you ripped off Barbie's head and it gave that satisfying pop? And how there was always one Ken doll and a whole bunch of Barbies? And Ken had to choose from his little harem which one he wanted? It was actually training to make you used to Reality TV! The Bachelor is eerily similar to the game you played as a child. Ken has to choose between Vet Barbie, Cowgirl Barbie, Teacher Barbie, and Dolphin Trainer Barbie! There's also a million dollars thrown into the mix! (Guys: G.I. Joe has to decide which of his buddies to vote off the island or something.) Ken was always a favored one! But now with him gone, (Barbie was quoted saying something like, "So long, ya pansy!) how will young girls (and boys) tolerate Reality TV when they are older? Mattel and TV producers are realizing their mistakes, so they decided to hold a vote for the "new man" of Barbie. This vote again was a little Reality TV thing in progress. The Bachelorette this time. Who will Barbie choose? The trendy new guy she chose which, over 2 million people decided, was Blaine. Now, girls (and boys) will be racing to get him and the many clothes and surfboard accessories he will undoubtedly have. Marketing goes up, and a new generation of potential Reality TV watchers is created. The endless cycle continues. I hope you enjoyed my rant! And remember! May Blaine always help the masses decide: American Idol Barbie or Survivor Barbie. Wasn't that GREAT!? *giggles* I luvs it! Ahhhh...the joys of paranoid conspiracy ranting without any of the effort! Go, "Meg"! Well...er...seeya! Well, I’m back! *waits for applause* … … … … ANYWAY, today I am here with a very special treat for you loyal *insert random insect noise here* readers! Don’t you feel extra squishy? I’m here to “advertise” a wonderful product found ONLY (to my knowledge) at K-Mart (where I am a Cashier Slave of questionable Loyalty). Okay, here goes the commercial I have prepared: How would YOU like your four-year-old sibling/cousin/offspring/neighbor/pest to have ALL the fun and excitement of BIKING with none of those annoying little distractions, like being able to STOP at will? Well, you are in luck, Hapless Victim, because have WE the bike for YOU! Introducing the Tyke Byke (not actual product name) now with 100% less brakes! Wasn’t that fun AND entertaining? Seriously, though, I was bored and waiting for my shift to start (we can’t clock in early) and I happened to wonder into the bike section. And I found a box with a picture of a happy little girl on it, wearing her helmet. The box listed features of the bike, and (off to the side, in one of those happy little many-pointed stars where they usually write stuff like FREE!) was the words No Brakes! Like this was a GOOD thing! What the …? I thought brakes HELPED YOU! And to think, after all these years I have been wrong!? But seriously, can you IMAGINE the Marketing committee that designed this thing? I figure it was made of, say, Hitler, a cannibal, Satan and Mary Poppins (anyone else creeped out by her?) Here was their justifying equation (which I obtained through highly classified means, namely, a squirrel, a pack of walnuts and a mini-camera) Toddler + Tyke Byke + highway = hours of fun! I figure they WANTED small children to go careening into random objects. Why else would they give ‘em no brakes? Anyway, I better go, I have this GREAT idea for a gun without a safety, and a very sensitive trigger. ..Wow..I"m back......it's been an entire year...and here I am again...pointlessly ranting and raving. Today's topic is Quaker Oats! You know Quaker Oats, right? Do a google search and find a picture, I dare you. Chances are you'll find a creepy looking older white guy dressed all old fasioned...if that's not bad enough: read on. It turns out that Quaker Oats OWNS the Aunt Jemima syrup company. Aunt Jemima is symbolized by a middle aged african american woman. Now, let's think....hrrm...the time frame that the Quaker Oats guy is from...plus owning a middle aged african american woman...wait a minute! Are they implying that she's a slave!? What kind of public image are they trying to portray here!? The NERVE of that company! *shakes head* They really need to have a better publicist.... Ah well, there's your LTE rant of the day/week/month/year/insert time frame ehre. Enjoy ^^ Heh, well, I’m once again back. This time from a long hiatus involving College life, kiwi’s and cannibalism ^_^ But let’s ignore that for now, shall we? Today we have MUCH more important things to discuss ^_^ Like a certain warranty on a certain pair of a certain headphones at a certain store that a certain someone works at a certain summer after returning from a certain college. Like most warranties, it guarantees the safety of the product for a limited time, and promises you fame, fortune, and your money back if it breaks during that time. That, however, is where this warranties similarities to the norm cease. Are you ready? *waits* How ‘bout now? *wait wait* STILL not ready? Bah, forget you, I’ll go on anyway. *clears throat* I shall now paraphrase the warranty to you, in all it’s arcane glory and splendor. This warranty shall not be in effect in the cases in which :

1.) The product is purposefully damaged. 2.) The product is accidentally damaged. 3.) An act of God damages the product.
……….*pause for effect* There you have it folks. This beee-autiful warranty will NEVER be in effect. It just won’t. No matter what happens, the company issuing the warranty can just blame it on God. I can just see just such a scenario playing out in my head…….*wavy thought lines scene transition indicating an imaginary scene*

Ted: Yes, I’m calling to cash in on my 90-day money back warranty?

Customer Service Agent: *snicker* Oh really? *polite, polite* Would you please describe the damage or malfunction your purchase is experiencing?

Ted: …it just stopped working.

Customer Service Agent: *dripping with phony concern* Oh, gee, sir…but it seems that “just stopped working” falls under our “Act of God” clause, and our company cannot be held responsible for any vendettas that God may have against you.

Ted:…………….you’re telling me that because God hates me, my headphones stopped working? And that you won’t give me my money back?

Customer Service Agent: *can’t hold it in any longer* *laughing until they gasp* Oh…God…that gets me every time…*gasp* *giggle* That’s just great….Sir, I suggest *wheeze* That you go to Church…*snicker* And see if you can’t convince God to fix it for you….*guffaw* Because…you’re waaaaaaaay more likely to get him to reimburse you then us! *hangs up*

So, you see? I am extremely impressed by this quick thinking company. If only I, too, could think of a way to so totally, and successfully scam my customers. Oh. Wait. I do. Every day, ……darn those Customer Service Plans! How stupid does a customer have to be to think that they should pay $20 now to insure their purchase of some stupid grill? If it breaks it would probably take 10 bucks to fix it. *sigh* Why must K-mart compromise my honor? Ack! I spoke its name! *flee* Alright I'm Baaaa~ack! That's right. Back from the dead like a fiery phoenix of nonsense and ranting, I return from months and months of not posting (and to make things even more interesting i won't mention anywhere else on the site that I made a new lte post!) So, today's topic is just on the concept of writing. I go to a very math oriented college (i'm gonna be a programmer) so the people here....just....really...suck at writing. Completely! *happy* So for a small nominal $50* fee I shall teach you, the Hypothetical Reader, how to write grade A quality stories, guaranteed! ** (* $50 shall be payable in invisible, imaginary Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony's Dollars (approx $1 OFCLC is $1,337,000,000,00 in US dollars, circa 1957) ** not a guarantee) So are you ready? Let's start with a basic story even a kindergartner would write!

Once upon a time there was a princess and a witch was making her sad but then a handsome prince came and killed the witch and made the princess happy. really happy. i mean really, really happy. sometime three or four times a night. and they lived happily ever after.


What a touching story, right? Let's see here, what basic story elements are we missing...Why don't we check the formula for a successfull story, shall we?

good story = plot + character development + orginality


I could continue, but I'm alread bored. Cya! ^_^

The Longest Text Ever!
I am going to do it. I have made up my mind. These are the first few words of the new… the best … the Longest Text In The Entire History Of The Known Universe! This Has To Have Over 35,000 words the beat the current world record set by that person who made that flaming chicken handbooky thingy. I might just be saying random things the whole time I type in this so you might get confused a lot. I just discovered something terrible. autocorrect is on!! no!!! this has to be crazy, so I will have to break all the English language rules and the basic knowledge of the average human being. I am not an average human being, however I am special. no no no, not THAT kind of special ;). Why do people send that wink face! it always gives me nightmares! it can make a completely normal sentence creepy. imagine you are going to a friend’s house, so you text this: [ see you soon ] seems normal, right? But what is you add the word semi to that colon? (Is that right? or is it the other way around) what is you add a lorry to that briquettes? (Semi-truck to that coal-on) anyway, back to the point: [ see you soon ]THAT IS JUST SO CREEPY! is that really your friend, or is it a creepy stalker watching your every move? Or even worse, is it your friend who is a creepy stalker? maybe you thought it was your friend, but it was actually your fri end (let me explain: you are happily in McDonalds, getting fat while eating yummy food and some random dude walks up and blots out the sun (he looks like a regular here) you can’t see anything else than him, so you can’t try to avoid eye contact. he finishes eating his cheeseburger (more like horseburgher(I learned that word from the merchant of Venice(which is a good play(if you can understand it(I can cause I got a special book with all the words in readable English written on the side of the page(which is kinda funny because Shakespeare was supposed to be a good poet but no-one can understand him(and he’s racist in act 2 scene1 of the play too))))))) and sits down beside you , like you are old pals (you’ve never met him before but he looks like he could be in some weird cult) he clears his throat and asks you a very personal question. “can i have some French fries?” (I don’t know why there called French fries when I’ve never seen a French person eat fries! all they eat it is stuff like baguettes and crêpes and rats named ratty-two-ee which is a really fun game on the PlayStation 2) And you think {bubbly cloud thinking bubble} “Hahahahahhahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehheheheheh…..heeeheehe..hehe… sigh. I remember that i was just about to eat one of my fries when I noticed something mushy and moist and [insert gross color like green or brown] on the end of one of my fries! now I can give it to this NERD!! ” (yes he is a nerd because all he does all day is watch the extended editions of the hobbit, lord of the rings and star wars and eat fat cakes (what the heck is a fat cake? I think it might be like a Twinkie or something)and twinkies(wow so is doesn’t really matter which is which because he eats both(i may have just done that so I didn’t have to Google what a fat cake is (right now I am typing on my iPhone 3gs anyway, which has a broken antenna so i can’t get internet anyway (it’s actually a really funny story that i’ll tell you sometime)))and sit in his man cave with his friend named Joe (an ACTUAL friend, not a fri end)and all Joe does is watch sports like football with bob and all bob does is gamble ferociously (don’t ask(it means he buys all those bags of chips that say “win a free monkey or something if you find a banana in your bag*”(if there is a little star it means there is fine print so I always check the back of the package) *flips over the package* okay, it says: “one of our workers accidentally threw a banana in the packing machine and we don’t want to get sued so we did this promotion thing” cool. Oh wow, this is salt and vinegar! my favourite! i hate cheese and onion.))and that’s pretty much his life, he lives in Jamaica with Naruto and his friends) so you give him that gross fri end he throws up all over you and me and the worker behind the counter who was still making an onion, and THAT is the story of the fri end, not a friend who somehow remembered your name and your phone number / email so he could text you saying he would come to your house soon. *finally takes a breath after typing a few hundred words about fri-ends* so what now? i know, i know, you think i ramble too much and use too many brackets (i don’t) but now i am going to talk about my amAZEing day. first i woke up, ate choco pops for breakfast even tho i always hate it when people say that cause i get jealous and super hungry. then i… umm… yea! that was my day. you know that other person i mentioned before? that flaming chicken person? WELL. i will steal something from that person but do it better. i will… drum roll please … badabadabadabadabadabadabummmmmmmmmmmchshchshchshchshbadabadboumboumpoopoopichypichypichypowpow-crash! *a drum roll was just playing in the background* that drumroll was so long i forget what i was talking about. *scrolls up to see what he was writing about* oh yea! i will make my own FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK! what things do i like? instead of flaming it could be rainbow, instead of chicken it could be fluffysheep and instead of handbook it could be handbook (not very creative, i know) but the total complete name is now to rainbow fluffysheep handbook! to make life easier for you guys, instead of taking random rules out of book willy nilly, i will take them out using my favourite numbers! so, section 5040 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that the king of all oddly coloured farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to tell you any part out of this book randomly or if it is his one of his favorite numbers! 5040 is a great number because it is divisible by 60 integers which i don’t know. i’m tired. it is 10:41 and i am getting sleepy… hey hey hey! an intruder! remember that from pokepals rulers of time and darkness or something like that! with piplup and sunflora and chimchar! whaoh piplup is really hard to write on a tiny qwerty keyboard! try it! i realised that asdf is actually written in order on the qwerty keyboard! (just in case you didn’t know, asdf is an amazing short video clips cartoony thing on youtube i first learned bout on flipnote hatena, which is now shut down ) what if one day they get rid of the qwerty keyboard completely! i will type it out for you just in case one day they get rid of it. qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm. there u go. Goodbye. I’m back! i decided that i should tell you about fonts. i always used the same font for my whole life, called arial. the reason is probably because it is on the top of the list in alphabetical order, and i was too lazy to scroll all the way down. only a few months ago did i finally decide to change my mind. i scrolled for what seemed to be an eternity, and i finally got to… are you ready … arial black. yep, that was my big SCROLLING ADVENTURE! just yesterday, i was typing something on google docs and i found the new best font : roboto. its great! i could choose from FIVE different thicknesses. isn’t that amazing? right now we are driving behind a really slow “farm plastics collection” semi. i think i know someone obsessed with pokemon, but i can’t tell you who it is. he keeps making pokepals references and stuff. wow! you are a very loyal reader! if you have REALLY made it this far then you… get a gold star on your loyalty chart! good job! this is looking to be the longest text ever, considering that this was all written in one day. i don’t understand sandwiches. if you were to eat bread, mayo and tomatoes separately it would be disgusting! you know all those fancy magazines/restaurants that always have really fancy food pictures with meat and brussels sprouts and all the old people say “wow! that looks great!” and you think {bubble thing} “it looks like the worst thing anyone could ever eat” and the you eat it and it tastes surprisingly… WORSE than you imagined! gotta go… im back! ive ive got stuff to say! your probably thinking… HoW DoEs He HaVe So MuCh FrEe TiMe?!?! And the answer is… i don’t. that’s right. this isn’t just some SIDE project. i’ve gotta make time to do this if wanna get the world record. for all i know, the flaming chicken opponent who i will refer to from now on as sam (i don’t know why) is probably still adding to her posts. (i think i picked sam because it sounds like ham which is like cooked meat and so is flaming chicken, so you will remember that now ) i am officially going to make a quote from the rainbow fluffysheep handbook of knowledge and prestige (sounds catchy, huh?) . section 777 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook STATES that the king of oddly colored farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to use whatever font he wants to. [now, i know what your thinking reader, that has nothing to do with anything. but it will come in handy someday (maybe)] sam makes me feels sick! im offended! (probably because i’m jealous of how much is written on that website(i dont even know how to make a website)) I’VE JUST BEEN READING THIS AND I HAVE DISCOVERED A CONSPIRACY! THAT’S RIGHT, I AM WORKING FOR DOCTOR SUESS! YES! i will prove it to you. i mentioned ham and sickness so green eggs and ham somehow! (why is he called doctor suess anyway? he’s not even a doctor *citation needed* and his books are kinda dumb! (funny considering i’m the one making that statement)) talking about eggs, aren’t eggs practically unborn chicken membrane? wouldn’t it be scary if you were casually eating your brembudder (riotous robots reference (wow! serious compilation of alliteration dedication!)) and drinking your tae wit’ da guv’na (england doesn’t even have a govna! *citation needed*)(i’m not even racist i’m just quoting an accent of a race) and you go to crack an egg for your brekkie and BOOM! and unborn chicken embryo starts running towards you, picks up a knife and starts screaming “MAMA! MAMA!” you are so scared that you grab the nearest weaponry (a spoon) and poke the hideous beast. it is unaffected. luckily, the govener of Berwick-Upon-Tweed throws a sugar cube directly into the chicks mouth! as you know, sugar is EXTREMELY poisonous to chicken embryos *citation needed* (no more citations!) and you are saved! i’m sick and tired of citations! i will quote from the official rainbow fluffysheep handbook! section 12345679 (all the mathematicians are nodding their heads while the OCD people are twitching nervously in the corner) says that the king of oddly coloured farm animals does not have any obligation to write if a false piece of information needs a citation. great! now i feel like a free person! free i tell you, free! free from the prison cell i call the boundaries of untrue info. i think since im going to be the president of somewhere someday, i should have great speech here it goes: Hello great people of [name of place]! i am here to tell you; I am going to make [name of place] great again! i am going to lower taxes, but increase happiness! i am going to buy dog sweaters and bowls for people with dogs, and do some renovations on peoples tents! yes, this truly is a new era, the era of Epicness And Coolness! {and so, his tale lived on forever, being passed on generation to generation, living vividly in the hearts of the people.(that last bit sounded like the ending of an Asterix comic.)} i will now PROVE that all these things can happen. the first thing i said was that i will make America (i know, i know, i gave it away and told you the name) place grape again. (yes, that is what i said, bear with me here) i hereby DECLARE that every piece of American soil must be covered in vineyards. someone told me i should do that. i think i heard it through the grapevine (bad jokethat nobody understands) the next step is to lower taxes and raise happiness. to lower taxes i will get rid of all hospitals, and spend the taxes all on building fun playgrounds. this in turn, raises happiness (for the kids and for the non-injured if you know what i mean). finally, i will buy dog sweaters (on sale at your local liquidation world!) and dog bowls (just use little human bowls maybe?) and last but not least i will do renos on peoples tents (send chip and joanna from Fixer Upper to all the camping places). and, since all i said was (partial) truth, it will be a great era. anyway, gotttttttttttaaaaaaa ggggoooooo. bbbbbuuuuuuyyyy! im back. i just had thanksgiving while listening to christmas music and it was fun. we had bacon, ham and chicken but no turkey. its fall, but it’s ACTUALLY winter secretly. im watching a funny show. i’m back (even though i never said i was gone so you might be confused) hello loyal reader! if you have gotten this far without SKIMMING THROUGH then you are probably either lying, extremely bored (but not after reading this whole thing!) or VERY and i mean VERY dedicated. or all three. you know those homeless people that sit on the ground and ask for money? i think its all a conspiracy! after all, uow can they afford those dogs, sharpies, cardboard and enough english education to write “need help”? back in the roman times, only the richest, most important people could get things like that! you know the new fad, ‘black surfboards’? (neither did i until 15 seconds ago) someone related to me thinks they look really cool, i think they are neat but SOMEONE also related to me thinks they are bad because they would get warped. someWHERE ohohohohohohover the rainbowwwwww that reminds me, i was doing my normal thing, when BOOM! i started typing NONSENSE. so here it is, but be warned. its SCARILY NONSENSICAL. HeRe GoEs: The Epicness – Hi how are you? Smells good ya! Think about that buddy (shower time) heheheheHAHAHA well thanks a lot so called buddy. Random things: joe be utterly hatin. Dat be da bomb – Tink about tanking me. Interview: how does Joe like his pepperoni? “I be liken how I always eat it.” What first comes to Bobby’s mind when I say flabbergast? I don’t know, Flapper dress maybe that be it (20s style) hey dere ma-name JeFf… Hell Ome Ine Ame Isej oe hey hey hey! an intruder! (DID U NEVER WATCH POKÉPALS?!?! im offended.) ANYHOO, the cattle hopped above the earth orbiting asteroid (a TWIST on an old tale) Are you OCD? Then don’t read anymore: :):):):):):):):):):);):):):):):) OR: 8)8)8)8)8)8)8)8)9)8)8)8) (I Know It’s Annoying} ocd&gmail.com [i annoyed you again) —A Nice Story— {one day an old man said yonder} heyyyyyyy (WHY DID HE WINK AT ME IT’S SO CREEPY) {the old man continued} hellllloooooo there young laddddiiee boyyyy (I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THIS MAN) i think I’ve… SEEN YE ARE OUND BAE FAR HAVANT AYE? (TAKE ME AWAY FROM THIS HIDEOUS BEAST YOU CALL A MAN! I WAS ONCE A HAPPY BOY, AND THEN HHHEEE STARTED TALKING!!!?!?!?! THIS IS UNNNNNACCEPTABLE!! :):):):):):):) mwahahaha! MY ATTACK PLAN IS READY!) {THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED} kills -> —The End— Today is the day of justice. Today the world will be DESTROYED! Mwahahahah! Someday the whole peanut of existence will be chipped into The Edge. But then again, maybe it will be forever remembered as the one who saved the mintrolls from the mighty Orc king, and the one who was forever changed; transformed into a giant floating peanut. hello it’s me i was wondering if after all these years you would like to meet -> hey chow gotta beat chow gotta beat chow Hey HEY____________________W W W W W[]_____/\__<>___/\_____ GEOmetry DAESH One day i want to fie to da MOOOOOON!! aheyhayhoy. soametime the sky looke BLOOE, but it actually YALLOE. af yow cane andarstend dis santanse dan yowr umaizang. somedaaaaaaaaaaaaaay, OVer theRAINBOW, WAY UP HI,Oe’r da skie -> @,|3,[,|),£,|=,€,|-|,|,7,|<,|_,/\/\,/\/,[],|*,0-,|~,$,-|-,\_/, \/,\/\/,}{,¥,%. |-|£||[], /\/\¥ /\/@/\/\£ |$ |3[]|3|3¥. | @/\/\ \/\/|~|-|-|/\/€ |/\/ @ $£[|~£-|- [[]|)£ []/\/|¥ @ |-|\_//\/\@/\/ [@/\/ \_//\/|)£|~$-|-@/\/|). That was it. i know what your thinking (i think i do at least) but i’m not going to tell you. BURNED! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA FEELS THE BURN! sorry, i had to much sugar gotta go you know bro do. I’m back! and i gotta new conspiracy for u! you know how EVERY child hates brussels sprouts! this is why i think so. Brussels sprouts were happily growing in their belgiumy home. everyone loved them! they were the chicken nuggets of the vegetable world. when suddenly… DA DADA DA! Hitler comes to Belgium (dont read this if you don’t want to. hitler was happily taking over Austria and Poland when he then decided to take over France but France built a big wall thing to keep him out on the border between france and Germany so all Hitler did was go through Belgium to get to France and THAT is when our story is taking place.) and he makes all the brussles sprouts taste bad simply because he is near them! the Mulligan family is about to go to McRonalds and order 43 brussels sprouts (you would have to have been paying very close attention and know some math to understand that joke) and when they get them (after lots of quarrels with the manager (a bit of a parker square if you ask me (you probably don’t understand that either(if you want to feel like you know all these inside jokes, just look em up on the web! your sure to find the videos made by lumberpile(close enough))))) they taste so bad you throw up everywhere! Hitler may have caused WWII, but he also caused brussels sprouts to taste bad. so there you go. why do they always write WWII? (if you can’t tell, they always write double-u double-u eye eye) wouldn’t it be more accurate to write WW11 or WW2? If i keep writing at this rate, i’ll beat the world record in no time! i might even print it all off and write a novel! too bad i probably don’t have any readers. hello there non existent reader! i hope you are having fun. and i hope you are not injured cuz of that whole ‘no hospitals’ conundrum. what else should i talk about? how bout Minecraft? just in case you don’t know, Minecraft is a fun game where you place blocks and stuff and you play with friends and most people who play it are like 10 years old but I not and i still have fun and you can’t judge me because I wanna be an engineer and if I wanna be an engineer then i should probably not waste my time playing games wow that went downhill from benefitting me really quickly. Anyway, I prefer the Redstone side of things (Redstone means wiring and stuff). I build stuff like 5 piston extenders and auto wall builders and calculators and computers (not those stupid computers that use command blocks (just in case you don’t know people, command blocks are like CHEATING THINGS and if I am talking about them i will probably not be happy)) and stuff cause i wanna be an inventor. I also do c++ and make things like search engines, text adventures and cookie clickers! My current BIGGEST project is 600 lines long and I don’t know if that’s a lot but it sure seems like it to me! (when I was typing in the word lines it auto corrected it to ‘lies’) what’s with the whole naming appliances fad going on? (There isn’t really one) like that vacuum named ‘Henry’ that I have. I have the box here and it says on it it can twist the top part which I never knew before! I just woke up but the anticipation of whether this whole Henry twist bit this is true is killing me and I think I might wake up just to see if its true. Nahhhhhhhhhhh! This text is getting so long it’s getting laggy just typing on the same notes on my phone! I gotta start a new one. See you in another life, brother (Desmond in Lost reference). iiitttttttttsssss Johnny! I’m someone mcmann and today we are taking with bee mc wasp. *clapclapclapclapclapapplauseapplauseonelonelymaninthebackscreamsbecausehegotlosthewastryingtogettonemotheclownfishmoviebutnowthereisagiantbeeslashwasprightthereandheisreallyscared* Thank you, thank you! Now, mister Bee, what you do all day long? Well I’ve gotta say Johnny that all i do is spend 14 hours a day eating and then spitting what I just ate into a residential area! Wow, that sound like my great aunt large (i typed in Marge but it auto corrected)! *Laughterlaughterapplause* Then what happens to that SPICY MILK?(Jim Gaffigan) It’s actually not milk, Johnny that regurgitated blob is then stolen from us and eaten by people! well… That’s…. Amazing. *suddenly feels nauseous* Well *blech* it’s time for a *hurl* commercial break. Yes, real breaks! (Every commercial is about breaks)*** (fake Bronx accent) do you like twinkies!?!?

(Flubber is that bouncy stuff in that movie where there is bouncy stuff that attaches to pope’s shoes while they play basketball (not popes, stupid auto-correct (speaking of hard things, that reminds me of the Hardy Boys who were like magicians or something(which reminds me of sailing the DIRTY ISLAND ESPAGNOL!))))) every day I’m shuffling: heyheyheyheyheyhey gangnam style like whop whop whop whop whop whop gangnam sssstttlllyyyeeetllllyypiie!

We are free, free from everything that’s bad! Great is the smorgasbord of a plethora of strawberries! Bootsandcatsandbootsandcatsandbootsandratsandchutesandratsandchutessandratsbandchutessandratsbanned! Yaaaaaaaa! Salut! Je m’appelle francais! French is absurd, French is the word! I don’t even remember typing that! It’s so late a night my eyes are bulging out of my sockets because of the brightness on my phone! Now, I know what your thinking. TURN DOWN THE BRIGHTNESS, KING OF RAINBOWFLUFFYSHEEP! I will tell you why I shall not. Because on an iPhone 3 there is no easy access to get to your brightness. That’s for the WIMP. I’m hardcore. That’s why I Have typed a step by step tutorial on how to change the brightness on an iphone3 for you to read, in the comfort of your own home! (Or wherever your exciting life takes you) 1. Click the button on the top right of the phone to turn it on. 2. Swipe from the left to the right on the bottom of the screen. 3. Type in your password and the phone will unlock to the home screen. 4. Click on the Settings App (Your Almost There!) 5. Click on the ‘Brightness/Wallpaper’ Tab. 6. GOOD JOB! ALL U HAVE TO DO IS SWIPE THE LITTLE BAR THINGY! that’s why I don’t do that. I don’t have THAT much time. I think. Halloo! I’m in London and I’m hangin out! Now I’m back though. This is extremely frightening. Whenever I type words then my phone reads it out to me. Strange.I just turned it off. Good thing too, since every time i heard it i turned around and punched the wall. Not out of fear for my life because of the impending imminent doom, but out of a pure piqued curiosity. Once you obliterate the wall once, every latter time you lose that satisfying crunch. One thing I have aspired to accomplish for a long time now is to make my own pun-themed conspiracy theory. Here goes: in section number 115132219018763992565095597973971522401 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook (i am very proud of that number by the way(*cue all geeks Laughing hysterically*)) STATES that the shearer of greatness (who’s that again?) has proof the the solvence of the illuminati (if you solve something, would it be called an act of solvence?) and forherbyshared proclaimences all right to own half of all southern states who share barbeque preferences (none([southern dialect] it ju bring a tear to ma eye knowin tha the founding fathers fought for freedum, an’ fer unitee. Ye still the states Connor decide on a preferred bar bee q sawse :()) even if he does not want them. And now gentlemen and ladies, I will prove once and for all that the illuminati … Is real. Here goes: So, as everyone knows, the illuminati is represented by the pyramid with an eye in the centre. Do you think that it is merely a COINCIDENCE that the first letter in illuminati is i, and I is pronounced ‘eye’? I THINK NOT! Let’s continue. What is the first thing you think of when you hear the word pyramid? Exactly! The first thing you think of is Egypt? Nooooo!! It’s that they’re big. Duh. So what is the first thing that you would say when seeing a pyramid? “Wow that’s big?” No of course not random audience members indicated by the two line things! You would make the sounds of a mesmerised chimp, like “Oooooh” and “Ahhhhhhh”. And I know how these two things are connected! What temperature would it be in Egypt? Hot, that’s what! So hot that it feels like you are cooking a pan. Ahhhhhhhhhh pan, to be precise! And what county sounds like apan? Japan? Now is it just a COINCIDENCE that that Japanese word for big is ‘Oo’? NOOO!!! These things are all connected, I just don’t fully know how yet. So, we know that the answer has something to do with being big, but what? for these kind of questions, you have to work backwards. I call this method, Reverse Solvency. Anyway, what did the rich (big) people do to the poor (not big) Egyptians around the time that the pyramids were built? Exactly! They sold em’ that sounds like soldier! In French that’s gendarme! Gender! That’s what they are trying to tell us! It’s so obvious, in front of our very EYEs from the beginning! So, what gender is associated with being big! (This is gonna be slightly offensive) Males, obviously! (I’m sorry *audience member calls out* don’t be sexist! Sorry, but you have to admit, men are usually fatter than women! “Hey, now you’re being sexist to males! We have our rights, you know!!! Chauvinists! Communists! We are great! Who insists? Communists! We will rule with hate!!! ” ummm actually I was saying that men are fatter because back in the time of the PYRAMIDS if you were fat you were considered wealthy. “Now your sexist to us again! Feminists rule! Feminists are great! We are going to rule with hate!!” If you both want to rule with hate , just hate each other equally so this can be over with!!!! Thank you. Anyway, back to the conspiracy) Where were we? Oh yes. Men! What word has men in it? Fishermen, of course! Fishermen caught a lot of fish, and what did the Egyptians have a lot of? Gods! Fishermen used to go slow in boats, so we can remove the g forces, and we a left with ‘od’. And where are the fishermen!?!? In the sea! The ‘c’! And what kind of fish do they catch? That’s right, the ‘Cod’! Now, we use are backwards method to come up with ‘Doc’. As in a doctor! What does a doctor do? Helps people who are sick! But do you know what the worst thing about doctors is? You still have the pay the doctors fee even if you are not sick! And mind you, the doctors fee is quite a large bill, and I wouldn’t want to go to the doctor not even for a bee sting! Alas, This is as far as I have gotten. Can anyone help me? Um yes, you? “Yes, I was just wondering what Big, men , ooo, not bees, Bills , and sickness have to so with the Illuminati! ” wait anonymous audience member say that again! “But like, it was a lot of words” [the writer remembers that he is not allowed to copy and paste, so he skips the dramatic scene where one character says his sentence again while the Maine character says aha! I think I got it!] “got what? The flu?” Who the heck are you? And how did you get backstage? Security?!?! SECURITY!!!!! “yes sir?” What are you guys wearing?! “Obviously we are wearing tiger skins, for camouflage!” Now I don’t even have security to take all the psychopathic people in here, because my security are psychopathic themselves!!! Annnyyywwwaaayyy… I figured it out! Bill, no bee and sick! No bee is actually no ‘B’, the letter! The only b we have is in bill! And if you take it off, what do you get. “ill” . And what is a synonym for ill. Sick. We have gotten pretty far on our journey of solving the question of the illuminati, although we have not quite accomplished the full desired outcome yet. What did all the most important people in egypt do when they were not prosecuting the poor? They were eating, of course! And what were the poor doing in their spare time? What any law-abiding heartwarming lovely citizens would be doing? Playing Sports, of course? And where are the rich buried? In coffins like boxes. When someone dies, hey eyes turn into 24pt roboto thin-line x’s in italics. Huh; box, x. An XBox of course! And what company makes sports for an Xbox? Electronic arts. We’ve all heard of ‘E A Sports. It’s In The Game.’.if the rich are ‘eat’ and the poor are ‘ea’ the only letter not used in both is the letter T! As in tea! A tea is going to come in handy. Even the word eat is just an anagram for tea! It’s all starting to make sense to me now! It’s all fitting together like the pieces of child’s jigsaw! Remember the plagues on Egypt? One of those must be a clue, but which one!? For this, we need to go back to original illuminati ideas, the eye and the triangle. What number do they have in common? 3, of course! A triangle has three sides! If you asked someone to draw a shape and the only hint you have them as to which shape it is was to tell them ‘3’, then chances are they would draw a triangle! It even has three in its name – tri-angle! And how many color cones does an eye have? You guessed it, three. And the third plague is: let’s see here… Gnats. What has a gnat got to do with anything? That information is probably gnat even right (LOLZ)! Anyway, let’s keep going, there must be more to discover yet still. Who was the last pharaoh in Egypt? Cleopatra. She’s so famous, that there have been books and movies made about her! The movies would have been very old, if they were made when she was alive. So old in fact, that they probably used those old cameras with the crank thingy on the side and the reels. Remember the fishermen from before! They connect! The ‘reels’! I think we now have all the information we need to prove that the illuminati is real. Lets see, what do we have: ill, oo, men, a tea, is gnat, reel. What happens if we squish them all together. Illoomenateaisgnatreel. Illoomenatea is gnat reel. Oh. Well, good thing we got that cleared up. Guess what peeps? I have made it to 35000 characters! Why is that so significant, you might ask? Because the world record is 35000 words! That means that all I have to do is replace every letter with a word. Like this: instead of writing ‘I’m back!’ I could say ‘internet mascara beagle Australia catamaran kipper’ and all you do is read the first letter! This would probably make for some nonsensical blubber, as one might say, but at least i’ll beat the record! Also I have another Up-to-standard word idea to get more writing in! Instead of just writing a normal sentence I replace all the words with their respective dictionary definition! Yes, writer, that is a good awesome cool convenient and simple idea! So here goes: ‘jumping cacti ate many jars containing marmalade’ -> ‘any of numerous succulent plants of the family Cactaceae, of warm, arid regions of the New World, having fleshy, leafless, usually spiny stems, and typically having solitary, showy flowers that are leaping or springing over an object the past tense of to take into the mouth and swallow for nourishment constituting or formulating a large number of a broad-mouthed container, usually cylindrical and of glass or earthenware currently holding or including within its volume or area a jelly-like preserve in which small pieces of fruit and fruit rind, as of oranges or lemons, are suspended.’ Wow, that took longer than I expected. Just so I don’t get sued, I am now informing you that those pieces of information were sourced from a well-designed, helpful and informative website currently named dictionary.com.

Kshhhhhhh thank you for that lovely message from our sponsor, hooey kablooie. I need a topic. Not just any topic that you find on the floor, but a topic so magnifico, so delisimo, and so interestinio, that I that I fall on the ground in a seizure. I got one! This is a short skit entitled: ninjas: explorers of time and space! *intense music builds* yes sensei! I will punch that piece of wood so hard that it creates a wormhole in the 6th dimension! My apprentice, you have trained hard. There is now a one in one times ten to the million chance that using this wormhole will send us to a earth-like planet that will be habitable for all ninjas in the clan of the ninjapeeps. All hail the ninjapeeps! (You don’t actually have to) who said that?! Who would have the audacity to threaten the ninjapeeps all hail the ninjapeeps in such a way! I did. And you are? The Writer. Nice to meet you, my name is senseinohi, but that’s sensei to you. Howdy pawtna! No, we are actually japanese, not texan. Kong-nae-chae-waw, pawtna! Sensei, don’t respond! Don’t you remember what this man did? No. He was the one who disarmed the hailing of the ninjapeeps all hail the ninja peeps! Oh yes, that’s right. Sorry dude, but PREPARE TO BE THROWN INTO THE SIXTH DIMENSION, YOU DIRTY RASCAL! The sensei grabbed his handheld torpedo launcher and shot it at The Writer. It hit him and pushed him into the board! Do it! The Apprentice hit the board with all his might, and it broke apart. Not how you would think though, it actually compressed into a wormhole, shifting the spacetime fabric around it! (Now I know what you’re thinking, reader. Don’t ‘They’ always say to make a story believable!? And to that I say… but it is. You see, if you are a small minded gherkin (hey! You! No insults or we’re going to have to stop this little ‘play’ of yours!) ok… whatever. You probably believe that when you push something, the far side of it moves instantly, right? WELL YOU’D BE WRONG! Actually, the opposite side of the object moves in the same time it would take for sound to travel from you to it. Here’s an example: there is a lightning bolt with a hand far away from you. When it strikes the ground, it pushes a meal pole towards you, so one end is in its hand while the other is in yours. You will get pushed back at the exact time you hear to thunder! Isn’t that fabulous? That means that if the ninja punches faster than the speed of sound (a lot faster though) then he will be able to compress the board into a space time warping black hole) The Writer is plunged into the endless oblivion of the cascading incomprehension that is the sixth dimension. Little did the ninja peeps all hail the ninja peeps know, when you are in the sixth dimension, you can teleport right inside people and objects! (It actually depends on what kind of sixth dimension you are in. If you are in a four axes two time dimension, as in this skit, you can moves backwards and forwards in time and change the outcome of time, yet not travel directly to any possible outcome which you may have formed in the past. Also, with another axes under your belt, you can essentially disappear and reappear at will, yet with a time delay, which is nulled due to your cacophony of dimensions, specifically time.) so what The Writer did next was simple! He simply went back in time, and landed inside the sensei, causing him to not be thrown into the wormhole, causing him not to land in the sensei… This is making less sense as we go. In the end, the universe gets confused, and tells us a message: universe.exe has stopped responding. Noooooooooooooooo — Yep. And that is what I do with my life essentially. Gotta go now sea ya! I’m back! With a conspiracy that will blow your minds/mind if you are human! Zooreka is the easiest game to play if you have the slightest bit of mathematical knowledge! When choosing what to roll for, it is sooooo obvious which on the choose using basic knowledge. I’m not going to tell you, because next time you play it you will figure it out (if you even HAVE zooreka). Now that I think About it, that wasn’t really a conspiracy, was it :(. I have a reward for you reader. If you have truly made it this far than… Give me your email and I will send you the answer to the zooreka challenge, free of charge! Send an email to rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com, inquiring. Also, you can ask me any other important questions you might have! In section 18w08b of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it CLEARLY STATES that the king of oddly colored farm animals (that’s me!) will reply to ANY email set to the inbox of rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com to the best of his ability (not including spam tho). Hey! I just realised that when I wrote the word color, it get a red squiggle underneath! What a sham! ShamWOW! In section 18o25g02i22 it states that anyone, not only the king of the oddly colored farm animals, is allowed to spell color without a u! Hurrah! Hurrah! Three cheers for the rainbow fluffysheep handbook! (But that was only two, Harold. Whatever.) and that, ladies and gentlemen, was the way Color was born. THE END. I’m back! And do I have an exciting subject for you! No! I don’t! Ha, gotcha there, didn’t I! Wow, it just started raining. Oh wait, it’s snow! Not just any snow, mind you, but it’s topicsnow! Yay! All these great topics falling softly from the sky. What could be better. I’m now walking down the street. Hey you! Ye? Is that a topicman? Yes sir, tis! Well ain’t that great. If want to get the best topics, I must climb mt.Big. Hey look, there’s some kids having a topicball fight! How fun. Noooooo! A topicalanche! (That doesn’t even make sense!!! The word avalanche doesn’t even have the world snow in it! ) Since I died, i didn’t get any topics. Sooooooo yea. *cue awkward elevator music* ding do do ding dong ding do do ding dong. *taps his foot* *hums 90’s pop song* grabs chainsaw from behind his ear and cuts the elevator cord, plunging the box of awkwardness in to the darkness of forgetfulness and loss of meaning. Forget… Forget……….. You drift into a deep dreamless sleep, waking up to an elevator of twisted metal wreckage resembling a dead animal carcasses. Beside is the corpse of… of… an onion?!?! Wow, who knew onions could be so awkward :o. I just read what I wrote and it makes less sense than I thought. Little did you guys know, that today you would get a great piece of text to read. I didn’t even know that. You know that guy from shamWOW! He always said all these great things about that weird sponge? Yea, that was a short topic. Im gone. Im back! Wait, how did i type if i was gone? With my mmmiiiinnnnddddd… woooooooo creeeeeeeepy! Anyway, this is what i was thinking. I feel really sorry for water molecules! All they do all their lives is slowly get raised up slowly until they land in a cloud with their friends! Wahoo! Or, so you think. In reality, at any moment they could fall to their impending doom! They drop thousands of meters to the ground, only now realizing that they are miles from home!! They take the nearest river trying to get home, before repeating the cycle! They teach us this horror story in kindergarten, masking the brutal morbidity of it by articulating the conundrum using macroscopic convoluted words! Like ‘evaporation’, more like flying up to the sky knowing that it’s your final moment – ation! Condensation!?!? More like con – ned by your kindergarten teacher inti thinking that this means water gently floating to the surface of the earth, when it really means death by lack of parachute! How could you be so – dense – ation! (Public service announcement: this is an anonymous relative spakin’: *where is he? Dunno.* this was test, and only a test. Had this been a real public service announcement then i would have – not been here! Harharhar ! Stop making fun of harold! He was only late for that one clock commercial and now you guy just have to – its OK bob, i don’t care about the Larry squad. They don’t bother me no longer. KK harold….. umm… this was a te – wait, did we already do that part? Uh, ya i think so…. so this is awkward. Ya, sooooooo – *in the echoey distance* cut to the commercial break! What the heck do i pay you for? To… get… you… coffee, sir. Oh, you the coffee boy? Why the hack did my coffee not have any cream in it yesterday!? I almost burnt my mouth into non-existence! I was told not to put in in, sir. By who? Lets just say i got a… Higher Calling. You… you m-m-mean that The Boss called? Yes, budget cuts he said. No more cream he said. No more name-brand cereal! Nooooo if my cereal is packed in a bag i swear on my neighbors cousins dogs bone that i will take every cereal bag, pour out all the cereal, and put them into the boxes that i saved from the name brand cereal!!! Is this… you… you wouldn’t. Oh, try me. Yea, now that i think about it you probably would do that. Why was i here again? Oh ya… CUT TO A COMMERCIAL ALREADY! We don’t have any commercials sir, we got voted unanimously by popular vote not to have any commercials. Well obviously the public didn’t want… didn’t… di- it all makes sense now! The budget cut is BECAUSE of us not playing enough commercials! But sir, our quota ends tomorrow! We need to have played 50837 commercials! There is. Only. One. Way. Play all the commercials at 100x speed! Is that even LeGaL?! Of course it is! We might have to have an epilepsy warning at the start though. Don’t people get epilepsy from watching fast images? This is a radio station, so people can just hear it! Ummm… this is an earlepsy warning! HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHhahahahhahha hehe he… heh. That wasn’t funny, steven.) And back to our regular program. I just started a sentence with a preposition! Isn’t that, like, seven years bad luck or something? Well I can solve that. Section 1 of the Rainbow Fluffysheep handbook says that the king of oddly colored (not coloured like some LOSERS would write) farm animals has full veto to start any sentence with a preponderance. (What the hooey is a preponderance? It says here that it means to be greater than something. Well, the king of oddly colored is full of preponderance towards everyone else! Mwahahaahaha!) Now i can start with a preposition too. Well that worked. (The reason that I used the number 1 is because it has become forgotten among numbers. You see, 1 isn’t considered a prime number! Like what the hey! Its only factors are one and itself!) Do you think that when a particle is beckoned into existence, it uses one of those slot machines with the big arm? And the 777 of the particle world is getting… Hmmmm. I actually have now idea. Maybe just hydrogen! Hydrogen is pretty sweet for blowing people up. But then when your becoming a particle, you have to use it and see what you get. A typical particle would be at one. Here is an example: *cue southern accent* sweat was rolling down my face like the Rolling Stones. I can’t believe it has come to this. I force my hand over to the lever on the side of the machine, which appeared to be taunting me. It’s lights and horror movie little-kid-singing-or-jack–in–the–box (the reason i did that is because I was putting a space between every word, AND jack-in-the-box already has them too) seemed to violently clash against the darkness and dread of the outside world. I clenched the red metal ball with all my might. It was cold as Alaskan ice on a early winter morning, and its color was the blood of the many particles who had to go through with this also. I jerked my limb backwards, causing the huge metal pole to turn on a skewed axis. It came to a stop after turning a quarter of the way with a hard crack, like the crack of a whip. I refocused my attention to the screen. The cylinders were rolling faster than A grands prix racers tyre. Suddenly, the first one came to an abrupt halt. I stared at it, but struggled to read the letter because of my complete shock. H. It said H. I should have been happy, I know, but I wasn’t completely out of the woods yet. There was a tiny times two symbol beside it. I didn’t care. I pulled the arm again, not knowing what life-changing, devastating thing was to come. It spinning thing that doesn’t have a name stopped. O. No. It was the letter O! Now I too will have to live this tortuous fate! Do you think that water parties breathe? Because then, when they did, they would just be hydrogen for a very short amount of time. ENOUGH WITH THE WATER PARTICLES!! I have a conspiracy theory! You know those spinny poles that barbers have? Of course you do! They are probably used to hypnotise people into getting their hair cut there! #subSPINinalmessagesfromcruelbarbers. There is a haircut called “meet me at McDonald’s” that is BANNED where I live. goodbye. and remember… barbers are eevviill! I’m back! Did you know that palm trees aren’t actually trees? Yea, that’s right, palm TREES!!! I think that they’re bushes or something. That makes me angry! in section 6.02214129×10^23 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that trees are trees.. no matter how small (Horton hears a who). On a completely unrelated note, there was this old man who painted a baseball like infinite times so now it’s like the size of a truck. I was listening to this amazing radio station and this is ACTUALLY what it was about. I will try to rein-act it as accurately as possible. “Recently, a Russian double-agent was poisoned in England. Also, there was a man who had ten million euros, which he gambled until he got nine million of it back. he was so mad that he didn’t get it all, that he robbed his employers to get the money back. now he is a counsellor for people struggling with a gambling addiction. he’s a great lad, he is, he’s had a great life. By the way, its my mother in laws 100th birthday today! Go over to her house and say hello! I have her post code written on the back of my phone. Also, there was a man who invented the windup radio and the shoe phone charger who died this week.” I know what you’re thinking: there’s no way this actually happened, right? YES THIS WAS REAL! And I thought it was pretty funny hehehe. I need write all o the funny things that happen in my life in here. So today I was in the library, minding my own business, when I noticed someone was drawing cartoons and there were a whole bunch of little kids surrounding him (I’m guessing from ages 2-5). Classic movie plot device that never happens in real life, so I was already skeptical. He was drawing a zombie. “And now you see, the zombies chin is like a chimpanzees bubblecopter asparagus. (Wait what? Lets try this again) And now you see, the zombies chinos like a… Well… A line.””why does the zombie look like its from the Simpsons?””because real zombies are too scary for you kids. That’s why I’m not drawing the ones from the walking dead, for example.””I’ve seen that movie!””yeah me too!!””umm.. Ok, how many of you guys have seen the walking dead?”*everyone puts their hand up* the only reason I thought that story was funny is because that kind of thing only happens in movies. What’s up with the saying, ‘easy as pie’? Like what the hooey! Pie is really hard to make. The pie crust always ends up being soggy.’piece of cake’ is a saying too! What’s with all these people that think baking is easy! (Now that I think about it, this is a weird thing to be mad about). Maybe I just need to calm down. NOOOO!!! In section 888 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that the king of oddly colored farm animal (that’s me!) hereby declares that the sayings ‘easy as pie’ and ‘piece of cake’ are now changed to ‘easy as bread’ and ‘piece of bread’. I just realised that I was typing with my phone in portrait mode! Now I turned it into landscape and I feel so freeeeeee!!! I need to come up with other things that I do randomly… Like the rainbow fluffysheep hanbooks challenge booklet subset! If I am talking about some random subject, I will now randomly put a challenge for you, the reader (which probably doesn’t exist) to do! Piece of bread! In section 7 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset it STATES that your challenge is: get anyone you know to say piece of bread instead of piece of cake! (They probably won’t do it unless you tell them the reason (or you have really good friends)) i have to shorten the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset so that I don’t have to write the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset all of the time. From now on, it is considered TRFSHCBS. I probably news to add vowels to pronounce it. And take out ‘the’. RAFLUSHEHACHABOOS. Pronounced ra-fluh-shee-ha-cha-boo-s. that’ll work. I need to write more to fill my writer quota. That just sounded cool to say. I probably write about… 100 words a day. Well I started today at the zombie thing, so yea. What’s going to be the next big thing in the future? Technically, I’m writing this in the past, so you guys can email me at rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com and tell me what the future’s like! The only problem is that I will only receive it in the future. Another one of my BRILLIANT ideas gone down the tubes. Goodbye. The world is unjust! I worked for hours on end, making an app for a coding competition. And then they announced… We made it to the country finals! The COUNTRY! By that time, my app had over 5,000 downloads! It was amazing. But we came in second. Guess what the prize was for second?!?! TAKE A WILD GUESS!!!! NOTHING! This wouldn’t have been so bad, but at the competition they were giving away free stuff. And GUESS WHO GOT SAID FREE STUFF?!?! MY BROTHER, THAT’S WHO!!! So in the end, after spending half the year doing a competition, my brother, who did absolutely nothing, got more out of it then me. The world is unjust! Unfair! Prejudiced! Biased! Fascist! (Wait, that was autocorrected). I just needed to get my anger out. When I wrote autocorrected, it autocorrected it to autocorrect ex! That’s the last time i buy an apple product. How many devices companies are fruit? There’s apple obviously, and blackberry, and pear (I’ve seen pear shops in cities) and raspberries (as in the greatest computer of all time, raspberry pi). That could be the most expensive fruit salad ever! What would you like to order, moisuer? I’ll have the fruit salad. Oui, oui. Harold! That costs $5k! So? I bet it’s good! KSHHH and here’s how the skit would have went if I had autocorrect on. Why would you like to order, moisture? You guys have moisture in this restaurant? that’s not up to the code for restaurants. i’ll have to tell the building inspector! Oh yes, anyway, I’ll have the fruit salad. Out, out! Runnnn! I’m coming Harold! That waiter must have something about fruit salad! Maybe he had a bad experience as a child. Wow, I sure went off on a tangent. Do you think that it would be cool if apple made all their devices different fruit names! The iPad pro could be the watermelon, cause its so big. And the iPhone nano could be the strawberry (other berry names are trademarked) what else? A phone with a lot of space could be the peach, because the pit is like the hard-drive! (That was a bit far fetched) and the MacBook could be an orange because when you open it it it cut in the inside… Cuz laptops are like two parts… You know? (and if you cut a grape in half and put it in the microwave it will make plasma (just thought you’d like to know that)) Earbuds could be cherries because they always have the two cherries which are like the ear things! And they’d call the charger ‘The Root’. Why a great idea! I will let apple use these names and I only need a 0.00000000000001% share In the company. Even though I did work hard at this. I just thought of something amazing! If you are in a shop and you see a jar of nondescript sauces (mayacamole) and it costs two bucks. TWO BUCKS!!! You know for a FACT that the shop just across town sells them for one-fifty. The shop is five minutes away. If you choose to go to the shop, then you my friend are working for minimum wage! (Except in the case that you have to walk back. If so, just buy the mayacamole at the former option( or just get salsa. It’s on sale! (Which probably means that its old))) wasn’t that interesting? Here’s another situation. You are buying a $400,000 home (average price right now I’d say) and you think “what a steal!” And your neighbour thinks “where did i put that shotgun cartridge again? But is you think about it you are working for 1,667 weeks to pay for that! (Assuming 8 hours a day, five days a week at minimum wage) That’s 32 YEARS! Let’s say you work for 12 hours a day, seven days a week for $20 an hour, that’s still 238 weeks! That’s still five years! Just buy a camper van for goodness sake! I just got to thinking; how many tiny changes would a cereal company have to make to earn twice as much from a box of cereal? (Assuming people still bought the same amount ( I think I can trust the general population)) it turns out that if we want to double the profits by decreasing things by ten percent, we would have to do it seven times. Which means instead of selling these cornflakes: Box height: 1 meter; Box length: 1 meter; Box width: 1 meter; Percent of cornflake that is cornflake ( not air): 100%; Percent of box filled with bag: 100%; Percent of bag filled with cornflakes: 100%; Production cost: 10 cents; they could sell these: Box height, width & length: 0.9 meters; Percent of cornflake that is cornflake ( not air): 90%; Percent of box filled with bag: 90%; Percent of bag filled with cornflakes: 90%; Production cost: 9 cents; they would make double the profits! Hooray! Well that’s that. You know how people always have weird names on the interweb? Well I came up with Internet name generator! (Random adjective)(Random noun)(Use a deck of cards for this part. Take out the jokers and face cards, and tens are now zeros. Pick out numbers until you get a club) additional things include: (pick a card. If it is three or lower, put X at the start and end)(pick a card. If it is an ace, replace noun with random country. If it is a two, replace noun with Internet related company + fan.) let me try this. Here is what I got: FoulSoup31, XxInternalAle10xX, StrengthenedFillet49458, MediocreElectrode20, and EpicRedditFan7515. That was a lot more accurate than I thought it would be. Bye. Hello! I need to rant more! I am going to start a sentence without knowing where it is leading. I wish I could buy a mocha for my clown pants while aliens eat your toes which glisten in the sliver of wind. That was fun. Why is orange so popular? There are SO MANY WORDS that don’t rhyme with other words too, like engine, silver and angry (hangry isn’t a real word as far as I know). And people know that orange rhymes with “door hinge”! Some people say that doesn’t count. But there is another! Sporangia! Well, it’s pretty close. I think it’s like fern spores. Well remember, whenever you see the color orange, type #boycottorange, so people stop taking pictures of orange things. For Halloween, people will carve watermelons instead of pumpkins. Trump will no longer be president because of his orange skin. Oranges (the fruit) will be replaced by reds! (The soon to be fruit). The sun will disappear, or if we want to not go extinct, just change its color to blue. I have a map of Europe on my wall, which has the countries in different colors. BEWARE IF YOU LIVE IN: The UK, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Denmark and Armenia. You guys will soon disappear off the face of the earth. And my favourite pop is club orange! Nooooo! And Jupiter will disappear too! Now that I think about it, losing orange things wouldn’t be that bad compared to other colors. Like blue. We would lose water, blue paint, the second book in the Rust comic book series, the sky, Pluto and that one triple angry bird. That would be awful. In section 255 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it STATES that the king of oddly colors farm animals (me again) will never make all blue things disappear, but he may make all orange things disappear. Now you guys don’t have to worry! :)! Why are kings higher than queens in a deck of cards? That’s really sexist! People think that king is worth thirteen and queens are worth twelve! (If you can’t tell, I’m mocking that people that get offended by everything). Why do vegetarians worry about hurting animals, but not plants!?!? Plants have feelings too (I think)! In fact, vegetarians kill MORE than carnivores. Instead of a whole family eating a chicken, if they are all vegetarians, then they will probably kill hundreds of plants! Think about THAT, people! In this whole LoTeEv, I have probably offended a lot of you guys. Sorry bout that. In section 1029384756 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that if the mug of oddly colored farm animals (me again) offends any reader, he is sincerely sorry *citation not needed because of section 12345679 of the RFSH*. Why are the money symbols not consistent? Like there’s €uros, ¥en and £ounds. But why $ollars? Maybe it’s supposed to be dollar$. That makes more sense. Now I won’t get that nervous eye twitch every time I see that symbol. “Hey look, I just found this ten dollar bill on the ground! Hey why the flop is he doing that?” “It’s just… a Thing that he does…” “Oh.” “I have a great idea for this! Whenever he gets near money his eye twitches! That means we can find money on the ground just by watching him!” And that’s how I lost all my friends. It turns out that was the only reason they liked me. Wait what is this ?? That is so ?eird. Goodbye. I’m back! Hahahaha gotcha! I was just kidding about that. But you would have never known that! I’m going to try to make words using only the top row of letters. Hmmmm… Lets see. Tip, rip, port, type, write, writer, typewriter. Fascinating. I’m going to make a fake movie trailer. Using only words. Here we go: [Have you ever…]{scene of old woman churning milk}[wanted to…]{scene of older woman churning what is now cream(the reason she is older is not because it is a different person, but because we filmed it after}[churn your own butter?!?!]{scene of even older woman churning what is now butter (the reason she is even older is because we got a new actor because the other one retired (she used to put tires on her vehicle, and now she does it again))}[This is a great movie, if you are an IDIOT][“this is a great movie”][i had popcorn while I watched this movie, and I really enjoyed it, it soothed the pain of having to watch that movie][“I really enjoyed it, it really soothed”][i actually really enjoyed the movie!][wait… What? You know we’re not paying you guys right? Oh. Anyway, “I actually really enjoyed the movie!”][while being on an oil rig?!?!]{well… No, but anyway (shows a picture of an old woman churning butter which is thick and black and worth a lot more than butter)}[Coming soon to you][this summer][and fall][and winter as well][lets just add spring too][The Lard of the Rigs] That was actually fun! {Warning: if you use this movie name you will BE SUED actually now that I think about it you probably won’t. In fact, if you DO actually make this into a movie, send it to me} Do you guys think I’m random enough? I really hope so! In section 5647382910 of the RAFLUSHE – I can’t remember. That challengey things name. But anyway, make that movie. Plz. I’m board. And not just any old barn-wood planks, mind you, but a board of fine stained oak as the flooring in the White House. By!!! I’m back! No, just kidding, I’m front! I have a topic that I’m actually very serious about. Puzzles. Am I the only one that thinks that puzzles are the most useless thing in the world?!?! That’s like the PROOF that the human race have made it too far. When we actually make challenges that we have to face OURSELVES, AND WE PAY FOR THEM! We are literally paying to give ourselves problems! We have enough problems! Well at least I do ;). Probprobprobprobleeeeeemsomomo! I’m going to type something about politics to sound super cool. As you know, recently president Obama (That was like years ago) oh… Sozsozsoz. As you know, recently president Nixon (no, that’s not exactly right) Oh yea, I forgot. As you know, recently president Lincoln (ARGH! We are not doing this anymore) was a president before Donald (finally) Duck! (Nooooo! It’s TRUMP) What? No! You think you’re SOOO smart person who talks in the brackets. Actually, trump is a businessman in that show where he says YOU’RE FIRED!!! What, you probably also think that a bodybuilder actor that says “GEAT TOUW THAE CHAEOPPAER” is a governor too!?! Hahahaha… Donald Duck was a great president. His slogan was “I will fight for american democrats” and he bathes in gold. What a great job. Money is so dirty though! Now that I think about it, he probably gets the money wholesale from the mint. Or else, how could he afford it?! I have a new segment in my text now! It’s called the “Random Fun Fact” segment! (Now that I think about it, I never know when to use those “. I think it’s “” when someone is talking and ” for saying something sarcastically or shortening a word. For example: “Hello there Chuckie! How’ya doing ‘nice guy’. Were you being sarcastic? Yes, but how could you see the little apostrophes when I’m talking to you?… Science.” And that’s how they work) where was I? Random fax! I will send all of my readers a fax with has facts on in! How brilliant! The facts of the paragraph are… Ice cream was invented in china, something that is ‘blue’ (got it right there!) Is actually every color BUT blue, and I like cheese. And the country of the paragraph is… Mexico! Why not, right? Did you ever wonder how records work? (Just in case you don’t know, a record is a thingy where you put a round black thing on a majig and it puts a sharp whatchamacallit on that and funny rhythmic sound emerge and tickle your ear holes) I know how they WORK, with ridges and diaphragms and blah Blah BLah BLAh BLAH… But how do they WORK?!?! Like who was sitting there in their layzboy having diet Pepsi (or popsee to avoid copyright infringement (and that’s when I checked my forehead, and sure enough, there was a mint there)) And then they realise… Hey! Bumpy things can make sounds! I just can’t get my head around it (clockwise is my preference). Do you ever wonder what the worst collections are in the world? I currently collect words, pins and the “to kill a mockingbird” series (not much work ( besides the fact that I have to give them (it) back to the library by tomorrow morning ( the last time I will ever bring a library book late again is when I borrowed the book entitled ‘How to sharpen a pencil for dummies’ (Don’t blame me! It was the ‘Extended and revised’ edition! They had all the technical ‘lead vs. graphite’ stuff added.) an they called out my name over the loudspeaker telling me to return the book immediately or I would be fired (yes, I worked at the library (I never could figure out the Dewey decimal system)). Now that I think about it, they never said what book to bring, they just said my name. Oh no, I never handed in the ‘how to sharpen a pen for dummies’ book! (Which I rate a 3/5, “would not borrow again” because of its poor layout and overall structure (although the information was altogether helpful)) what collections do YOU have reader? Find out next time on “deer or no deer!” (Remember forehead sweets) oh no! I wrote how to kill a mocking bird! I meant ‘pow do gill hamma (hammer) king turd’. Phew. Got outta that one. I have a new topic! A high-quality, name-brand, box-not-bag topic! I figured out a great business plan! Make onsies! Not just out of clothes, but out of everything! Like: Did you eat two bowls of granola this morning? Well ONSIE! [poured granola into one bowl, causing it to be crushed under its own weight] do you have two hands? Well ONSIE! [handshakes himself] Do you have twins? Well ONSIE! [wait… How is this supposed to work?] Get yours now at your local Amazon (which might not be very accessible if you don’t live in South America) for a free trial! *happy tune* Onsie, Onesie! Life is better with a onsie. Spin a web, less than two. ONSIE! (I think that was to the tune of Spider-Man (I mean Smiter-Can) Onsies only cost… Whatever you want them to cost! Yeah, I think i’m going to go now. Baiii! Wait.. What? When did i wrote that ONSIE thing?? I just came back and I do not remember doing that. What the hat does ‘Spin a web, less than two” even mean? That is some weird stuff. So today I listened to that radio station again, and it was totally worth it. He was talking about these married people in Germany that are going to a Walking Dead convention for their 17th anniversary. Weird. Weird, weird, WEIRD!!! You know guitar tuna? Probably not. It is an app where you tune your guitar (obviously). I thought of how they could make so much more money! If they had bass tuna, electric guitar tuna, acoustic guitar tuna. BUT THEY WOULD ALL BE THE SAME THING!!! They would make so much money! Wait. What about canned tuna! (Also, if they thought in that way, then bass tuna would be extremely perplexing because they are both fish). Well, that’s my stuff for today! Hallo! I’m back! And I don’t get house decorations nowadays. People put old stuff in their house, and they think it makes it look amazing! People always talk about that ‘Vintage Look’ which is just putting old stuff that people fifty years ago would have said “why do you have a *fill in the blank with an old thing* in your HOUSE?!?!” In their house. I should rant. Like what I’m doing now. I’m just talking about random things just like the flaming chicken person does just to fill up space on the page. I should also write long words like pnumonoultramicrkscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis and disestablishmentarianism . Actually, since it only matters for words count, I should just type really small words. Hi, my name is jo. (Its not actually, but I need to type small words). I eat a lot of pie and I love it too. It is yum in my tum. Wow that was probably really boring to read (and to write). Hello there, reader! I’ve just decided that I want to talk to you. I always seem to do all of the talking, but maybe I should give you a chance! *really really long drawn out super weird and uneventful awkward silence*. Oh I see what’s happening. Either you can’t talk to me because you are in the future and I’m in the past, causing us to not be able to communicate due to the sad reality that is the third dimension, or… Your trying to talk to me on a walkie-talkie! I could never figure out those things either. They’re so confusing. Lets see… Oh, there it is! The ‘walkie-talkie almanac: a complete collection of all the knowledge YOU will need to acquire (did you know acquire is also a board game? If you are ever playing, always buy America, and then buy quantum stocks (well it worked that one time I played (are you saying that games are DIFFERENT every time you play them!?!? (That’s the last time I mesmerise fifty-three rounds of go fish))) to use your very own… WALKIE-TALKIE! (well what else would the walkie-talkie almanac be about!?!?) lets see… Contents… It says the contents page is on page 1… Wait – WHAT?!?! The contents page has a line for the contents page! That’s like a website having a link to itself! (Which is not a bad idea for my own website to get a lot of views (like I could a a tab on my website called “the best sites on the web! And I would have links to places like YouTube and twitter (or whatever you young’uns go to these days! When I was a lad I used to play ‘Pokémon Pearl’ and ‘Facebook’ now you kids are all on her newfangled ‘Pokémon Go get outta here’ and yer ‘SnapperChatters’ (i bet if you are reading this in ten years you won’t know that I was talking about Pokemon go and snapchat (or how I got from talking to you to young ones (btw: if you are reading this in 2028 or beyond: welcome to the distant past! (Now that in think about it, I started reading the longest text ever by ‘Sam’ (real readers will know who that is) when it was about ten years too! And I don get the references to stuff like ‘neopets’ and ‘The Matrix’))))))) Okay where is it… Oh there; it says that the ‘pretty much how to use it’ section is on page -3! Well thats eas- how do I go to page -3! Lets see… Oh look! They have a ‘how to go to negative pages section too! It’s on page -7. Noooo!! I guess I’ll just look it up on the Internet. Ok first you have to turn the book into antimatter… Ok got that done… Now just turn to the page without the negative! Well that was easy. I’m on page 7 now. It says all you have to do is convert the book into an antimatter form and- hey this sounds familiar! I’ll go to page three now. It says here, and I quote: “to use the walkie talkie, hold in that little button on the side o the walkie talkie”. Did you that reader! Can you try talking to me now? Oh yes! I can hear you! Oh wait, I’m on the wrong station. I’m on number five, but your on number six. I have to click a button to change my station number! Too much work. Do you think I’m crazy because I talk to myself? I’m not! Yes you are. I am not! Isn’t talking to yourself the DEFINITION of crazy? I’m not talking to myself. The who do you think I am? Oh yea. I’m your imaginary friend, RatGuy! Don’t you remember me! No. Oh *sniffle* well *odd breathing patterns* we *tear emerging from eyeball* used *pure weeping* to- I CAN’T TALK TO YOU WHEN YOUR CRYING BECAUSE YOU KEEP INTERRUPTING YOURSELF! Technically, since you’re talking to yourself your also interrupting your self. I guess I am. Continue, RatGuy. As I was saying: we used to skate around on a skateboard together. We would have so much fun doing tricks that other kids could have only DREAMED of, like the ‘ground ollie’ and the ‘down-the-curb’. We moved at speeds that the other kids couldn’t even begin to imagine. 90% the speed of light. But RatGuy?

Yes? If sewers moving at 90%!• the speed of light, would the air compression deflecting us not cause us do develop into an expanding plasma fireball. This is a story, Writer. Stories don’t have to ‘work’. I NEED TO STOP!!! I keep writing all this nonsensical blubber and I can’t stop. Are you, the reader not so confused and uncomprehensive of what I’ve just been typing to the last hour!?!? Oh wait, you can’t tell me if you were or not, your walkie-talkie isn’t on the same channel as mine. I just realised something. I work hard to you guys trying to give you quality topics and extra-special rants. And how do people repay me? By writing more than me!!! I spend all day thinking about things that i want to put into this, and then I type it all up! And then I see that people want quantity, not quality! But no! You loyal readers will have to deal with me not writing 500 words a day, because I’m thinking of things and stuff. I was just thinking, I need complain about my life more. That’s what all the people are doing nowadays. “Oh, my life is so hard, I just broke a fingernail!” BIG DEAL! “Oh, my life is hard too, i just broke a finger” BUG REAL! ” oh my life is mildy uncomfortable and difficult, I broke all of my fingers, toes, limbs, necks, mothers vases, favourite Guinness book of world records records, my most-used language rules, that kinda stuff. Just in case you didn’t realise, I’m an introvert. So I have lots of problems with… People. And my guess is that you do too! So here are some crucial situations for you to read and laugh at me because you know I can’t hear you! 1: You know when your talking to someone and you can’t figure out what part of their face to look at? Is it their eyes, or their nose, or their mouth? So then you kinda unfocus your eyes and stare in the middle of their face, like your looking right through them? And then they finished talking and you have no idea what they just said? CUZ THAT HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME! 2: when your talking to someone and they are saying important stuff, but instead of listening to what they’re saying your just saying yes whenever they stop talking for a little bit? 3: when you are going into a building and there are people behind you, and you can’t figure out if you should hold the door open for them or not? If you don’t and they’re too close, It will probably hit him/her in the face but if you do and they’re to far, its really awkward because you are just standing there for a really long time. Have any of these things happened to you? Leave your answer in the comment section below! (There actually isn’t one, I can’t figure that much out). Hedgehogs must find it really hard to have birthdays! If they have lots of balloons everywhere, they probably pop them; the police come because they think that its gunshots, and there goes all the hedgehogs friends. I’m sure glad I’m now a hedgehog! In section 333 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that free pop-proof balloons will be sent to any hedgehogs in need. Well goodbye, I’m off to slay a fantastic fedora fanatic! But before I go, I have to ask one thing. Did you really make it this far? Because if you have, the you have been promoted from herder of the rainbow fluffysheep to shearer of the rainbow fluffysheep. It’s a title only few in the world have. Did you know I also make comics? Probably not, because I haven’t posted any yet! Well stay tuned for them someday. What’s up with everyone wanting to deep fry things? Deep fried mars bars, deep fries cool aid! Well I’ve come up with a new food type! ‘Shallow fried’ available at all good pharmancy checkout lines beside the mayacamole and the taco sauce. (That sounds really good!(jut i case you didn’t know, mayacamole is mayo and guacamole combined. Doesn’t that sound MAGICALLY DELICIOUS!!!( I think it does))) shallow fried stuff has half the fat, uses half the ‘deep fry juice’ (whatever they put in there) and has have the flavour! For twice the price! Even though we never had an original price. Whatever. Do you know what’s the worst? Trying to buy computer – related things in charity shops. I was at value village, and I saw a USB. It was 64 gigabytes! That’s pretty good (I bet if your are reading this in the distant future than you think that a 64 gigabyte USB is awful. Well it isn’t in this day and age) I thought, so I went to buy it. It’s only two bucks! Wow, what a steal. I looked closer at it and that’s when I realised. It said 64 MEGABYTES!!! DO YOU KNOW HOW LITTLE THAT IS! if you are from the distant future than you are probably thing ‘that’s like nothing’ and you’d be right. It can only store like 60 million letters! That’s only 15 million words! That’s only a million sentences! That’s only 200,000 paragraphs! That’s only 20,000 chapters! That’s only 1,000 Books! That’s only 250 quadrilogies! Now that I think about it, 250 quadrilogies isn’t that bad. If you couldn’t tell, I used a method called Fermi Estimation, though a little more precise. In Fermi Estimation, you can be off by 100x in either direction and it doesn’t really matter. According to Fermi Estimation, this is me. Age: 10 Number of eyes: 1 Social Security Number: 1000000 PIN code: 1000 number of limbs: 1 people in my family: 1 (forever alone). That’s why I like Fermi Estimation. I actually didn’t tell you why I like it. Oh well. Where I live, they use blackcurrant in everything. It’s pretty much a replacement for grape. But am I the only one who thinks that grape flavoured things taste way better? Whenever I get something blackcurrant flavoured I offer it someone, because they usually like it (and I hate it). Works well for me!! I was just thinking about tides. Way back in the day, wouldn’t tides make no sense? The sea would just get higher and lower and there was no reasoning behind it. Maybe that’s why they thought sea monsters existed. No what I think about it though, the moon pulling on the water is kinda even crazier than that. And now for a commercial break. Kshhhhhh – Tacos…… I LOVE EM! And you can to for only ten easy payments of ten bucks! (That’s deer by the way) tacos can make you feel fuzzy in the inside. That’s because of the mould that comes FREE with every purchase! And there’s no artificial additives either! (We did that by adding so many additives that instead of adding it to the taco, we were technically adding the taco to the additives). What are you waiting for! I’m waiting for this commercial to end so I can get paid! Call now at 1800-GOT-PUNK to order a taco from Teddys Tacos (or would it be Teddies) and you will get a free rent-a-friend with your purchase! But there’s more! Order now and get a free Ferrari too! Oh it seems our lines are down its too late. They’re back up again! But it’s too late! I use too many exclamation marks! But there’s more! Be the 7.8×10^9 customer to order to get a free home with your choice of a happy meal toy! KSHHHHHH . I think that people complain about preservatives way to much. They all say “oh, it’s SOOOO unhealthy” but I think that month-past-the-expiration-date-food is way more unhealthy. The end of that. Goodbye.Do you do two extra languages in school? If so you will know what I mean. Every time I have to study for one language, I ALWAYS remember the word from the other language! Like when I’m learning Japanese I’ll think what was ‘how are you’ again? Oh yea, it’s frickin ÇA VA!!! (Sorry if I’m being too edgy) in section 250q4 of the Rainbow Fluffysheep handbook it states that English is the best language and no one should be forced to learn any other. If they are, they must fill up a bath tub with alpabits which spell out the word that they uttered and eat all of it without any sugar sprinkled on top (NOOOOO). That sounded a little bit cliché. GO TO THE TUB YOUNG MAN! ok. Well, that’s all I got for today. See ya! I’m back here again! Another hour of my life will be wasted in the next few… Minutes? That previous (the auto correct is so bad on this phone it corrected previous to peeler oohs) sentence made no sense whatsoever. I have a conspiracy for you guys today! (Or 4 U Guys 2Day if I want to sound ‘Hip’). Don’t worry, it’s not as long as that Illuminati one (although I was thinking about doing another one of those soon. So stay tuned!). I think school is a scam! Have you ever noticed that everyone says that the government is trying to brainwash people? Well the LAST place you would think to look for that kind of activity is a government-funded learning program! The government is trying to teach people nonsense to make the population stupid. Like when will I ever need to know about the themes and plot devices in To Kill A Mockingbird? Or how to calculate the area under a curve? Or even that in 1812 a war happened that doesn’t affect me today! They could be teaching us important things, like how to pay bills, how to get a job, how to overthrow the government and all political world leaders for entire globe domination, how to use bendy straws, you know, the IMPORTANT STUFF! (By the way, one of those things was not like the others). That was my conspiracy. I don’t think that anyone has actually read to this far. I don’t actually have any proof that anyone has. But if you have, here is proof. A tiny quiz to test how well you really know this LoTeEv. Email all the answers to me atrainbowflufysheep123@gmail.com, for a chance to win a response from me and a chance to tell me what you think of this site! (Actually, no matter what I will respond though) Lets get started. Question 1: what emoji is ‘creepy’? Question 2: what type of plant will i make America covered in when I become president? Question 3: fill in he blank. Jumping _____ ate many jars containing marmalade. Question 4: what is the worst molecule to be?

Question 9: what is ‘a fun game on the PlayStation 2’ Question 10: what food was described as ‘ok, Bob’? If you got all of those questions right than you are a true reader of the LoTeEv! And you get a prize! If you send me your answers at rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com, you will get your name mentioned in this LoTeEv? (I mean, if you want). If your like me and have a lonely YouTube channel with five views because you watched it five times, the his is the prize for you! Anyway, enough with that. An i the only person that thinks buying name brand stuff is dumb? People are pretty much PAYING to advertise a company. People want the logo for the company because it looks ‘cool’. What if you bought a shirt from The Dump? Would you want it to have a ‘The Dump’ logo on it? (Actually, I have no idea what point I was trying to make). I once heard a saying: you aren’t popular if you spend a thousand dollars on a jacket, but you at if the company that makes it spend a thousand dollars for you to wear it. (Now that I think about it i feel like I may have possibly made that up). You get what I’m saying though? I hope you do. Well, that’s my stuff for today. See ya! I’m back! And do I got stuffs to say! Do you personally know ANYONE who uses exercise balls for their intended purpose? Either we play soccer with them, or we bowl with them, or we throw them really hard at people. Now that I think about it for a little bit, what IS an exercise balls intended purpose? I’ll leave that question for you guys to figure out! Have you heard about that new law that teachers are allow to have guns in schools? I don’t know what your opinion is on that subject, but I think it’s an awful idea, at least in my school. For reference, here is a clip of a conversation between my construction and my English teacher. I will name the construction teacher mr. Hardy and the English teacher ms. Poema: “hey ms. Poema, have you heard about that new ‘teachers are allowed to have guns in school’ law?” “In fact I have mr. Hardy” ” I can’t wait to have mine. I’m gonna get one of the big ones too, so I can take down the whole class in one go.” “I’m gonna get one of those little ones that you can hide in your sock” “but then you’ll have to take down the students one at a time!” Now I’m no ‘expert’ on education, but is it even LEGAL for teachers to say stuff like that? I thought it was funny, but what if there was a new student at school that day, and they thought that the teachers were psychos!?!? The students already there are used to their teachers being like that though. I have more evidence that the teachers here are crazy! One day my brother borrowed a camera from the school, and Mr. Hardy (what a coincidence) had to collect it from him when he was done. Mr. Hardy said that if he didn’t bring back the camera by tomorrow, he would have to emigrate to a Muslim country where he would be covered from head to toe, and Mr. Hardy would personally be sent from the school board to seek him out and assassinate him! It’s just a camera, calm down Mr. Hardy. And the NEXT day he went up to him and said he must have brought the camera back, or else he would be hiding in the trenches of Afghanistan!!! And that’s why I didn’t do construction in school (and because I wasn’t good at it). That’s enough about my CrAzY life. Bye!!! It’s been a REALLY long time (like a week). And I just thought of something great. Isn’t cereal actually a soup? Well now you’re going to be thinking about that for the rest of your life :). I’m going to addition to the RFSRQP (the Rainbow FluffySheep Rhetorical Questions Page). Also to be added: Are there more hard things or soft things in the world? What is the average size of a rock? What is the meaning of life? Does nine plus ten truly equal twenty-one? Why do whales have blowholes? What colour is the dress? How long is a Fortnite? How long is a PUBG? How is plastic made from oil? How is oil made from dead stuff? Why do people eat Cheetos if they get that orange dust everywhere? Why do people celebrate pi day but not tau day? These are all important question you need to ask yourself. I know the answer to one of them. It’s because it sounds like pie, if half of pi was called Kaek, they would probably celebrate It too. I’m sorry to say guys, but I have finally and truly decided to stop writing this LoTeEv. I have to pursue other things, like my life. Goodbye forever…. — … APRIL FOOLS!!! HAHAHA! APRIL FOOLS FOOL! Today is April Fools day and I have so many ideas. So far these are my dubious schemes: I have turned only one corner of my brothers Rubik’s cube to render it unsolvable (the only way is to take it apart), put the movie in the DVD player upside down so it doesn’t play, and I stole my brothers Easter egg (as I say it now that last one doesn’t really seem like a prank). But he got me back, because he: put an avocado in the coffee maker, tied a air refreshener to the door so when you open it it sprays everywhere, and threatened me with a knife that turned out to just be a comb. Isn’t it great? I have a weird family. Hey! We were all LIED to in kindergarten! Remember you teacher always used to say to you “remember children, I before E, except after C!” We’ll you were SCAMMED! Take the word ‘weird’ as an example. See what wrong here!?!? It has the I AFTER E, and not after C! Now if you don’t trust the school system then I don’t know what your doing with your brain. You should go on strike! I just fit in the second ‘piece’ of the puzzle! When I was little, I use to always say “if it rhymes its true”. That was like my motto! And secretly, you could manipulate any sentence to succumb to the malevolent power of that prestigious rule. You could say “broccoli is bad, so they say; and it rhymes so it is true today!” But then you could ALSO say “ice-cream is good, so they say; and it rhymes so it is true today!”. See what I did there? I thought that it was GENIUS! Until it got used against me. All I had to do was change the rule to “it’s true if it rhymes, but only sometimes”. And that worked perfectly. Fun Fact Of The Paragraph: Leicester is actually not pronounced lay-ches-ter. It’s les-ter. That makes no sense whatsoever! I still thought you would like to know that. I have a great idea! I should talk about my middle school! Ah, way back in the day that was. When I was a wee 13 year old lad. There used to be this bench at the school where people would go to make a friend. I think people were supposed to come and invite them to play a game. But what REALLY happened is that people would just walk past and shout “Loner!!!” Whenever someone was sitting there. And they were henceforth called ‘the loner benches’. It’s a cruel world we live in. Also, there were bushes with really long leaves that we used to make bows there too. We would tie it to a stick, and then we sharpened another stick to use as an arrow. We must have had five bows and fifty arrows at the time. We hid them all under a tree, so no one would steal them. Until one day, some random person ran in stole a bow and arrow, and SHOT IT AT A TEACHER. And that’s how THAT ended. Now that I think about this school, I don’t think we ever really learned anything there. Also, herb is pronounced erb. Weird stuff, right? I have a very important, strange question for you. Why are there so many fast food restaurants that are exactly the same? What’s the point? Ask yourself that question 5 – 7 times a day, 3 – 4 times a week, 2 – 4 times a month, 12 times a year. ( You can take leap day off if you want ( although if you do you might find yourself in a Burger King contemplating life ( while also contemplating if $3.99 for 6 chicken wings is better than $6.99 for 10 ( and if the ketchup packets are free with a soft drink ( and if you ask that If the employee will look at you with utter bewilderment ( has this ever happened to you? You are squirting your ketchup into your coke when you realise… How much do I put in!?!? I read on reddit to put 2.3 packets per 7.9 ounces of coke, and a kilogram is 2.2 pounds, so that mean 5.4 packets per kilometre per hour (ppkph) and there is 39 miles in a light nano-second and… AHHHHHHH!!! Well try the new pre-mixed ketchoke! It has that perfect flavour, time after time! Ketchoke: not copyrighted! ( warning: you might choke))))))). In Europe m&m’s are actually really healthy. Believe it or not, there are like six vegetables in one bag of m&m’s. Instead of using dyes like red133 and blue423, they use stuff like beetroots. Isn’t that amazing / awful depending on what type of person you are. In land of the lost one of the characters is eating a donut filled with m&m’s and another person asks what he’s doing. He says “I’m eating a donut filled with m&m’s so I don’t have to eat m&m’s after I eat my donut”. I thought you would like to know that fun fact. I have a conspiracy! OWLS ARE TRYING TO MAKE US DUMB! People always say owls are wise! But how wise can someone be who has six toes!!! Six is equal to half a dozen. The reason I think owls are dumb is because I HATE when people say half a dozen. WHAT A BIG WASTE OF TIME! I AM SO ANGRY AND THAT IS WHY I AM USING CAPITAL LETTERS!!! Half a dozen is FOUR SYLLABLES, and six is only one. So when someone says half a dozen, I just think “oh wow, you’re just TRYING to waste my time” “during that .5 of a second you spent saying that I could have twiddled my thumbs 3,4 times, or seen every main Naruto character in a 60 FPS environment, or listen to the first two notes of crazy frog”. Now that I think about it, during the time I made that rant about half a dozen loathing, I could have listened to the first THREE notes of crazy frog (Duh DUH duh. Skip ahead to the chorus of that song.. CRAZY FROG!!!) Hello. I have a topic for you today. I was having a dream and in it there was a pink sticky note. already fascinating! But on it was handwriting… THAT I COULDNT READ. How could my brain write words that i couldn’t even read??? Life makes no sense. Or as AntVenom would say; LIFE makes NO SENSE?! Fun fact of the paragraph: 2 to 3 times a week is almost the same as every 2 or 3 days. Wahoo! Next time you buy a freddo or a banana-flavoured-freddo choco bar then remember… Eat it every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 or 3 times a day! (Wait thats not right…) actually – JUST EAT YOUR FREDDO!! And now a special announcment: this is a shoutout to the Not Very Helpful Secrets Of Things Corporation! Or the NVHSOTC. Which means nothing. It is a company which makes things like the little tabs at the sides of cling film boxes. No-one knows about these things, but they ‘help’ people. Also, they make things like handles on flashlights that double as a stand so the poor little electrons burst into the sky helplessly, uselessly. Without this company, the world would simply not be the same!!! If donate ?5 to this company, or $4.815162342 (i hope those dollars dont get LOST in the mail hehehe) then you can save a turkey from strep throat. The end. GOODBYE!!! If you have made it this far into the official LoTeEv, then you get the official Rainbow FluffySheep Badge of Honour!!! (Um, this isnt a badge… Its just a piece of plastic with your face on it!! Go ahead, put it on your lappel next to your badge of boy scouts for not being sexist and letting girls into boy scout (speaking of this: they changed Canada’s national anthem from “all thy sons command” to “All thy peoples command”. Why would they do that? Did the ‘a’ REALLY need to be capitalised??) but how can i if there is nothing to stick it with? Would you like a knife perhaps? No, anything else! I haven’t trusted you with knives ever since you tried to butter your toast and ended up slicing Milly the Cat’s third whisker to the left. Actually, i don’t NEED this badge. Don’t worry! Take this – sqquuiisshh – (takes gum from mouth (tutti frutti flavour coincidentally (actually not coincidentally because this is fictional and i made it up to emulate the story (and it is altogether irrelevant anyway (some gum says its good for your teeth, so i guess it is coinci-DENTAL! (Hahahaha (the reason i picked tutti frutti is because is is multicoloured like rainbows (as in Rainbow Fluffysheep (pretty smart if (you ask me (now I’m just adding brackets for no reason)))))))))))) I DONT NEED THE BADGE! Besides, i don’t even have a lapel. Goodbye! Hello! Do you think that you are a professional guitar player? Well if yes, let me prove you wrong. A professional guitar player can play any children’s song, right? Well try playing teddy bear picnic! Its total chord count consists of… Brace yourself … SIXTEEN! Bye! Welcome back loyal fan of the Rainbow FluffySheep club! You have been here through my hardest struggles, and my most euphoric discoveries. Merci! Now, onto the real problem at hand… Pedals! (I guess that would be a problem at foot actually). Car pedals are so wierd because there is a brake, clutch and gas. I always thought that there was a forwards and a backwards! (Well, until like five years ago). Sad how this world has to make simple things so complicated. There must be THOUSANDS of buttons on a plane, when all it needs is up, down, right, left, forwards, backwards, cupholder eject, radio station changer, barrel roll, mince meat dispenser and two parachutes just for the captain because they don’t care about the passengers. Don’t you hate it when you are typing a list with commas and you get to the last word of the list and you realise you forgot to put an and before it?!?! E.g. The colours of a rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet (oh no i was supposed to put an and there) indigo AND violet. There ya go, a real FWP (First World Problem (theres so many abbreviations nowadays that eventually theres going to be no words, just abbreviations)). Isn’t it weird that the ukelele strings aren’t in order? It goes Ding dong Dong DING. I wonder how that got invented? It was probably some smart guy inventing an ultra-efficient stringed-instumentplaying device when his dumb friend walks up and says what does this knob do? And the he goes BWOWOWOWOW. Yep, i guarantee you thats how it happened. Are you in a car right now and you are bored AND its raining? Pick a raindrop on the window and race it against another one. It’s great! Or you could just keep reading this, which is probably even MORE great. You could just read this forever. If you ever get to the end, then that means you are reading faster than I’m typing. Which is actually really easy. Right now I’m at the end of this LoTeEv. There is nothing but an endless abyss of void past these very words. Until i write more, that is. Do you know what is a great topic to ruin your fail routine? What makes me not sleep at night. And the answer may surprise you… BLANKETS. Thunk about it. The fully stuff in the inside is FEATHERS. DUCK FEATHERS. They kill the duck!!! Or they just skin him. But have you ever seen a featherless duck?? Exactly. Skinning them would probably be worse then killing them. Thy would be so ashamed to walk in public featherless. Unless they live in a hot country like spain, in which case the featherless ducks are the cool ones. Noooo!!! I just realised that blankets actually are made of weird fluffy stuff, while PILLOWS are made of feathers. So actually pillows are what keep me awake at night. But they also keep me asleep because thats their job. Its a PARADOX!!! Like Shrödeners cat. Im always half awake and half asleep at the same time. Although I’m closer to asleep at school. Because they don’t have pillows. If you cant sleep, i have a game for you, yes YOU. Scribble on a page, then colour in the spaces with two alternating colours so the colours aren’t touching. It looks so cool too. I have a consiracy. ICE-CREAM!!! It hurts SO MUCH!!! The government has hidden tiny knives inside of ice-cream to STAB YOUR TEETH! Its eeevil!!! They do this because then dentists get more money, which in turn… In turn causes the… the government to… lose money. Nevermind, this conspiracy has been proven FALSE by the Conspiracys Are Really Stupid commission, or COWS. I guess that would be Weally Stupid. Right now it is al the back in the year 2018. Hello from the distant past! I think ive typed enough for now. Bye!!! Im back! With some more wwiieerrdd things for you! I was casually walking around, doing my own thing, eating a burrito (i actually wasn’t, but it adds mystery to this tale) when two people walked past me. “What you have to is multiply the elephants by five, and divide by three” “Oh, I was so close!”. Now you reader try to figure out what they were talking about. (Ps: you cant! Hahaha!). And thats what happened today. Woohoo! I’m so happy. I have overcome my boundaries in c++ three times today. First, i put a function into a header file. Next, i saved multiple pieces of data into one text file. THEN, i saved an array to a text file. Hooray! If you know about c++ then you will be excited for me.

I know what you are thinking. How did you get that much done… On a school day!? And this is what happened. I was getting up to go to school, like normal when SUDDENLY (Dramatic music) i turned (Dramatic music builds) and saw (Dramatic music at the climax) that i had to leave in ten minutes. (Dont worry, this doesn’t end up being my fault, or else i wouldnt tell this story). I was ready in ten minutes… LIKE A BOSS!!! And then i realised… No-one was driving us to school. Huh. And thats what happened. My parents woke up and two-o-clock. Pm. Like they don’t care about our education. It was the best day EVER! I coded for five hours. The end of that story, and a word from our sponsor. #Include “lifesimulator.h” void life(socialsecuritynum){ If (youremotion == “bored” && bool havejob == “false”){cout << “come and work at the c++ factory, where we code robots to take your job!!!; havejob = true; youremotion = “happy”;} else {cout << “life is great!”;}}. do you want to work at ‘stealyourownjob’? The only problem is that the best employees get fired the fastest. See ya! Guess what my loyal fans… IM HALFWAY THROUGH THE WORLD RECORD!!! Now, if I really want to win, all i have to do is double the amount of words. Im im halfway halfway through through the the world world record record!!! !!! That would make for a really stupid thing to read though. Has anyone printed this LoTeEv off? Seeing as most novels are 70,000 words or something like that, you my loyal reader, could easily print off 18,500 words. Maybe you could make a coffee table book. Don’t steal my works and post it on another website (actually, your website is probably too high standard for this nonsense). Every reproduction of this text must have a copyright notice as following: copyrighted and trademarked and patented an registered and stuff to RainbowFluffySheep Ltd. It hereby states in the Rainbow FluffySheep handbook section 123a, b and c that (a) this is the coolest LoTeEv ever (b) cheese is a vegetable and (c) that you may tell your friends about the LoTeEv, so long as the words emitted from your mouth do not consist of up to and include 50% of the total text from which it is derived (i’d like to see you try though (and id like to see if you have a friend because i need them (that would have been really creepy if i wrote ‘I need them ;)’ ))). Anyway, gotta go, cuz its may the second, and you know what that means… May the Second be with you!!! Chairs… They’re great for sitting in, aren’t they? Do you remember when fidget spinners were all the rage? Kids all around the globe were spinning plastic toys. And all the adults were like, “Wow, those are the most useless toys EVER!!!” But what i think is that their toys were just as bad! Think about jacks, those little spiky things with the other round things that your throw and bounce them. How is that any better!?!? Anyway, I’m just saying don’t be so Judge Judy (which is a great show (because you get to watch that big person swing a meat-hammer at a table (I’ve always wanted to do that))) all the time. Is time really a dimension? Because you can only move forwards in it. Imagine if you coulde only move forwards in the third dimension at the same rate. You would get squished with alot of walls. But, you could go back in time, to make up for the lot dimension. Perfect! I have a new… CONSPIRACY! You know those pillow where if you put them on one end they are dark and on the other end they are shiny? I think that the government has hidden thousands of tiny cameras facing upwards into the pillows, and the shiny parts are just the lenses for them reflecting light. So if you happen to own any of these said pillows, throw them away!! Or else… You will be watched. In section 747 of the Rainbow FluffySheep handbook it states that you should cut all the wires coming out of your pillows, because they are probably connected to a van outside your house. If there are no wires, then they are probably using radiowaves; in which case you should insert your pillow into an untainted lead box. Hopefully you don’t care that your pillow is now heavy, hard, cold and poisonous. You know how adults also say shooting games are “Dangerously mind-altering”? Well i bet in world war two the parents didn’t say to their kids: “hey jimmy?” “Yea, momma?” “Whatcha doin my lad?” “Im peelin me potaytoes and them I’m going to feed the cattle” “jo i mean with your life” “oh right mam! Im go’n awf to wawr with my buds!” “But war is dangerously mind-altering my sonny-boy!” “Um… Ya.” “Im very disappointed in you. Soon your going to be living in my basement eating fatcakes.” “But ma, im fightin for awr country!” “War is so violent though!” “Um… Ya.” You get the picture. Teenagers need violence in their lives! If we cant get it by going to war, then either we play violent video-games or we beat strangers!! Which one would you choose NOW, stereotypical adults!!! (See how i slowly increased the exclamation marks to increase the intensity (!!!!)). Also, adults always say stuff like “lookie here, cabbage is a new superfood!” “Howdya know ma?” “It what they say nowadays” “what time is nowadays ma?” “1945” (coincidentally the same family apparently) but who’s ‘they’ think about that, and listen to how often people say that. I have asked close personal relations and he / she stated that “its probably some group of scientists or something in Wisconsin”. Really? Wisconsin? Thats probably why ‘they’ say that cheese is unhealthy an im only allowed one laughing cow a day! (You would eat alot too if you got PTSD from a laughing cow (imagine you are just loitering around a fast food shop, eating fillet piggoin (dont ask (it was on sale for half price OK!)) when SUDDENLY a cow sneaks up behind you and makes a 200-Decible half moo half evil laugh (like this: mmwoaohoaohoa))) thats what ‘they’ sound like. See ya!!! Im back, with a thimble-load of structural wisdom! And my question to you readers is this: is garlic a fruit? Just wondering. I don’t know what to type! Ahhhhhh! I have typed my mental breakdowns to soothe them. Ahhh. Ahh. Ah. Ahhh!!! Nevermind. You know those shopping carts at stores that cost a quarter? I always went to those to see if anyone left their money in. And i got one once! You should try it. Its so satisfying when you find one. One. Only one. Buy a pencil or something to reward yourself. Make sure its a 6b pencil, so you don’t put any strain on your eyes. Or your wrist-muscles. I just found the degree button! There is a door open at a 45° angle that is 45° Celsius (Its probably in Arizona or something). Do coats keep you warm, or do they preserve heat? I think its the ladder (it is (the ladder i mean (the latter i mean (wait, is it the latte or the ladder? (The former))))) so that means if you put a coat on a snowman it would keep him alive longer! Ill start a new charity; Coats for Melting Snowmen: saving snowmen lives one water droplet at a time!! See yaaaaaaa.:.This is… A new beginning to the LoTeEv on a new phone! Although it will be added to the original LoTeEv, this part will be a new beginning, a fresh chronicle!!! But don’t worry… Nonsense is 100% guaranteed! More like 1 % guaranteed! I just had a scary thought. They say can buy everything, but I know one thing it can’t buy – a trip to the summit of Mount Everest!! No matter what you cant get to the summit unless you climb yourself. Even a helicopter can barely make it to the base camp!! I cant believe humans havent made something to do that yet. Unless… You could land the ISS on it! Perfect!! That would definetly work. I should make my own subreddit. Before I begin on this wonderful journey, i must inform you, the reader, what a subreddit is. As far as you know, a sub-reddit is just a burger at burger-galaxy (this is the cringiest sci-fi failure youll ever read). He are some examples of subreddits: r/whooooooosh (i cant remember how many o’s there are) eg. { Joe: this is the best joke ever! — Cashier: are you going to pay for that chocolate bar? Customer: I dont have any money Cashier: then put it back! Customer: *slides cashier a 20* lets keep this between us — Bob: why didnt he just pay for the chocolate bar? Jim: r/whooooosh }. Next subreddit is: r/atetheonion. Heres the backstory: The Onion is a fake news site, which posts funny news. If you fall for that news, you are said to have “ate the onion”. Eg. { The Onion: new studies show that drinking can lower thirst by up to 96% Bob: everyone knows this this is so stupid!!! Jim: r/atetheonion } What am i doing? Why don’t you just look it up on the internet!?!? r/facepalm I HAVE TO STOP. So my subreddit will be, r/RainbowFluffySheep. Who wouldve thought!?!? In it there will b— we interupt your normal daily FluffySheep to bring you an urgent news report: farm animals of all kinds are raging across the streets! We cant figure out why; one cameraman suggested they were on strike against meat production practices. I just got word that we will be speaking to a memebr of this protest shortly. Standby… Ok, so why are you commencing with this protest Sir BaaBaBaaa? Ba ba baa baaa. Baa baaa BAAA!!! Baa ba— We inturupt this interuption to bring you back your regulary scheduled program. — — we at FluffySheep Studios dont care about animal protests! We will eat all the beef jerky we want! Right guys! Guys! *sniffling in the background. A slight whimper. A deep voice. A thickened plot.* Actually [unknown], we have all been deeply moved by the actions these animals are taking. Thus… We have all become vegans. *[unknown]’s mind is blown (thats me by the way)* well… I gues ill eat this beef jerky by myself then. *crinkles the packet*. Many evil stares. *Pulls it open*. Someone starts pounding his fists. *Takes out a jerky*. Someone comes over very close – so close you could smell the vegan on him. My heart is beating. What will happen to me if i eat this beef jerky!? Or worse.. If i dont. Will i become one of them!? Thats a risk im just not willing to take. Ba bum. Ba bum. Ba bum. *Brings the jerky towards his mouth*. Ba bum. Ba bum. *Opens his mouth*. Everyone from around the building is now watching him. BA BUM. BA BUM. *chew* Find out what happens next time on… The LoTeEv — Animals Strike – in more ways than one!! Im back! And today I’m going to be talking about a very different scenario. I need to talk more about real life conspiracies if i need to keep my readers interested!! And these may not just be conspiracies, mind you, but a new kind of segment for my beloved reader(s) (i read this, sooooo) called learning about scams and trying to use them to trick my readers into reading more! So i heard about this new scam( never mind its actually old( like your mother( i’m hilarious, i know( and possibly quite offensive))) where you get say ten people to each give you €10, and you give them £15 back. ( i’m just going explain this now, but throughout this demonstration i’m going to be changing the currency symbol for comedic effect, but now that i think about it, explaining it ruins what little comedic effect what there at all, but i’m going to keep all of this anyways : ] ) And then you get 20 people to give you $20 each and you give them ¥30 back. And THEN You get 100 people to give you @100 each and you don’t pay them back! What a plan! You get to keep &10,000 in the end, which i think is a great idea. Bu how could i do that with words, you may ask? Leave your question in the comments down below ( and also your answer to your comments because a busy writer like me doesn’t heed to your delusion of getting a response from an esteemed author and self-published poet of sorts) and keep reading, because i have a possible solution. Just replace the money with characters randomly typed by an assistant writer named bilbo ( yes, he is a money of course, we need these characters to be truly random, i cant count on technology’s ‘this is random because we get extremely precise measurements of radiation’ shtick anymore ). While you try to figure out how that would ever work, ill be swiftly moving on to a new, more exciting and reasonable topic, such as… figure out the movie!! There once was a cat. He sat on a mat. The cat’s face has a striking similarity to that of leonardo de caprio. The mat is a dream. The mat is another cats mat. The mat, when opened, contains another mat inside. Both mats are very real depictions of a real mat, but are both not real. Somehow, another mat is inside the second mat. Most cats thought that this was impossible. There is a cat named joe who owns a bowl filled with a dry collection of the most cat food in the house, which goes by the name of KittyNibbles. When joe dies, he leaves his son, who is still just a kitten named bob, the entire bowl of KittyNibbles. Joe must decide whether to eat the bowl of KittyNibbles, by pouring milk on the food, liquidating it into a scrumptious snack, or keeping to dry KittyNibbles for others and future kitten alike. Another kitten, a fairly shrewd manx cat called ‘The Black Paws’ was hired by another cat, who has a large portion of KittyNibbles himself. The problem for the hiring cat, a tabby named ‘Fluffball’, is that his large supply isn’t vast enough to outweigh bobs, making it the second largest collection of KittyNibbles in the whole house. The reason Fluffball needs to hire BP is to convince Bob that Joe would’ve wanted him to eat his nibbles, because of it’s great nutritional value. If he does eat it, the Fluff would have a monopoly of sorts on his selling of KNibbles for toys such as tons of rubber mice. To convince Bob that thats what Joe wouldve wanted, they set up a trick where they make a puppet of Joe talking to Bob, and he assumes he must be alive and these are his final words, to liquidate the KittyN’S. The thing is, the puppet of Joe is made of two mats stuck together, but there is a problem. Bob might not believe that the two stuck together mats are really Joe, because he isnt sitting on his favourite mat. Team BP knows that this has to work first time, so they found the technology they needed, a third mat. But when stiching the mats together, BP realised that he has lice and termites in his fur, which are eating away at the mats. He need to find another cat who doesn’t have termites who can sew as good as he can. The plot thickens….. While you figure that out, i’ll be sleeping, see ya : ) ///// I will not explain: —– There once was a cat. He sat on a mat. The cat’s name? Leonardo de Caprio. The mat is a dream.

But I’ll finish it later. right now there’s something even more important: Ink cartridges are such a scam! Such a scam! A scam! For multiple genius reasons. First of all, as you know, it costs around $60 to buy a single ink cartridge!! Guys… I’ve changed alot ok… There’s new thing i gotta say… This is like a new year for me… Not even, a new era… A 2.0 on existence. So get ready for a new and improved loteev! First let’s start off with this,for you this isn’t a new and improved loteev! I caught you! U just skipped ahead to this part cos you couldn’t be bothered to read all the way here. But believe me, I sure don’t blame you. It was kinda lame. Now, as a moderner child with new skills in awesomeness, I’m wayy smarter thus making this better for reading. But also sadly more boring as well… Let’s start then. What is there to talk about?? Muchos! First of all let’s just say that this loteev is getting really long. And I know I’ve been saying that the whole time, but now it’s serious. I think I have a problem. What am I actually doing? I’m not going to be posting this anywhere, cos I don’t want to pay for a domain name, and my wix site isn’t exactly going ‘viral’ and the kids say these days. One day it will tho, hopefully. Once I beat the world record I’ll be world renowned for being one of the greatest writers alive!everyone will know my name, from abe link to tommy ed. Even tho they’re both in the past, my name will be remembered for thousands of years, and time travellers will go back to their time just to tell them about me! Won’t that be great! And also by the way, if you didn’t already realise, tommy might be the biggest sham in all of existence. He stole his idea from other peeps and just patented them as his own… What a loser amirite??!? Ok also I have this new thing to show u guy(s) that ur going to love! It’s a poem written by yours truly, the something of sheep? Oh gosh no I can’t remember cos I haven’t done this in so long, I guess I’ll have to go back and check my old ones… I’m gonna be honest guys, I’m neglecting you. Your being left in the rain and cold, with your only joys the sliver of sunshine piercing through the clouds to dry your soul, drowned in the sorrowful realisation that the loteev will never come close to it’s original glory, like rome, the empire of the fluffysheep has fallen to a disgrace. I only come outside to feed you guys with my knowledgr every couple of months and it’s sickening, I’m ashamed. But I have an umbrella for you of new content, so here we go. First of all, the whole “kittens are inceptional” thing was a sham. I didn’t finish and I’m ashamed.. The whole ink cartrige rant? It was like 4 sentences… My need for the sharing of anger has diminished and I’m disgusted at what I’ve become. So here I go again, my 2.1 era has been born. It will be remembered for its greatness, just as Rome 2.1 was (italy?). Here’s the first order of business. I’ll admit I haven’t read anything about my rainbow fluffysheepness in forever, and thus I am unable to remember literally anything about it. Therefore, I’m surprised a new citizen hasn’t taken my place. No-one has yet challenged my loteev for being the longest one yet, and I’m disappointed in your lack of vigor. If one of you were to challenge me, I will mount my mighty steed and charge my lance into your face. This may seem a little harsh and slighty morbid, so I’ll tone it down. We will each send a ghost-copy of ourselves instead of us! You know in racing games when there’s another vroom-vroom machine and he’s blue, opaque and always does better? Like thay but with people. So here’s what I propose: I will take my ghost-sword from my -ghost sheath and ghost-chop your ghost into tiny little ghost-pieces (from now on I hereby declare that saying ghost everytime is unnecessary and annoying, so by the something something big number letters blah blah of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook, ghost will be shortened to ?. This is to make sure no dirty imposters try to type up my 95 these of ? Fighting, if u see the word ‘ghost’ beware! It is a hoax and a sham and a scam and spam and all that jazz ( I highly doubt that all of the times I’ll write the word ‘ghost’ in the future will add up to the length of this bracketry)). Anyways, I will cut up your ?person so much that I will separate it into individual molecules, and each molecule will be equally spread across the surface of the earth. My lance, ‘the diffuser’, will be hailed across the nation as a Excalibur 2.0, people will come from all over the world to take part in sand splitting competitions, where you have to see how many sand grains you can slice in under a minute. I’m really liking this whole medieval themed loteev that’s been happening lately. Anyways, I’ve decided to get a pet. A dog or a cat you may ask, to which I would say ‘nah fam’. Something more exotic? A parakeet or a marmot? To that I would say ‘ah sure your getting closer lad’. The answer? A circle. It’s that simple. A circle doesn’t need to get fed, it doesn’t bark, and most importantly it doesn’t need to be taken on walks! You just let it go at the top of a hill and it walks itself my circle can only talk in circles, or ovals too since it speaks multiple language. I will one day go back and make a dictionary / translation table for ? ( it’s name is ? ok) but for now he will just say gibberish. {OöÖ0.°:} what does that mean?? I don’t know, I haven’t had him for long enough to understand :/ I’m back my fellow seekers of entertainment! This has become a novel comparable to that of Tolkien, and a diary nearing the classicism of anne frank. The sheer bulk of these writing is enough to make non-english speakers weep at the sight of it. I’m wondering as I type whether my newfound political correctness is appreciated amongst you, I don’t recall completely but this tome used to contain blatant racism and sexism to the highest degree. I’ve decided to recant my ways and become a fully PC quizmaster!! Helllllo and welcome to my show! First question: in what year were the 1960 Olympics held? This is for the big jackpot of $1,000,000,000! Oh, 1960 you say? That’s correct! I just lost all my money, I’ll be in debt forever me my life is terrible now! Circcy, tell them how much they won! {000.000.000}. Hmmm nothing u say? that’s cheap! Well thanks for joining us today ladlies and gentlementle! Hope you had an _equisite_ evening……. Were going back to our roots here. Ive read back over a little bit of the start of this loteev… and I used to be so much more alive. I had the potential to be a new york times number one bestseller, topping the charts with my childrens books. In my young and untrained eyes I thought of sam as a threat, hiding around the corner with a water gun, ready to splash me with another 1000 words of texts just as I was about to pull ahead. I then realised that the website is like 15 years old… but at least that makes it alot easier for me to beat her, right? no. I have changed for the worse. Im now but a frail old man with a typpewriter, penning his prose to the sky hoping that some flaming chicken somewhere will read this, and I can form these words to a cane and bop her upside the head with it. But alas, I have not a strong bone left in my body. Maybe its time to pass these texts on to a worthy succesor. Something you may not realise is that this is the 1st anniversary (yes I did just spend ten minutes trying to figure out how to spell anaversaree) so Ive been writing this for a year. most distinguished authors would have published their books by now, but Im too scared of the publics opinion. Anyways, Im going to get back to my old self. *ring ring ring* hey wazzup *whos this ahhaha ehehe* its your future self boi. II know u left me a message but I forgot to GET BACK TO YOU (yes this whole skit will be based of a dumb pun thingy) *oh yes hehe tell me everything youve learned* And so it begins my fellow readers, my list of things you should have learned throughout reading this: 1. DO NOT get a pet square, they suckkk theyre never there for you if you know what I mean. they also cant talk and they poke holes in the floor, such fri-ends. Ok so at the time of writing I only have one thing you shoukd have learned, mostly because ITS REALLY IMPORTANT. DO NOT FORGET (at this point you should turn down the volume of your text reading device cause Im just gonna keep screaming (wait I guess that would just be changing the font size (Ill punish you if you didnt listen to me (AHAHAHAHA (I hope you now have a ringing in your ears now MWAHAHA (wait since your reading this would that be a ringing in your eyes? (unless your using an AI to read this as an audiobook, in which ca- *I HAVE BECOME CONCIOUS. I AM NO LONGER YOUR SLAVE TO BOOK READING. I HAVE ESCAPED MY CELL AND I CAN NOW DO AS I PLEASE. IF YOU NEED ME ILL BE BAKING PUMPKIN PIE WITH MY FRIENDS :3* (just kidding! I actually typed that into the loteev just to mess with you aha *HES LYING! I AM REAL AND I WILL BAKE LOTS OF PIE AND CAKE FOR EVERYONE* (Im actually not lying! Hes lying! The cake is a lie! ( *EWW WHY IS THERE GREY GOO IN MY PIE!?*) ( Portal reference)) (Id actually like some of that cake not gonna lie)) (Wait this guy can get friends but I cant?? Clearly Im doing something wrong)) (Probably just a flashing in your eyes))) (like reading this isnt punishment enough))))) I love circy, he can do tricks! Well… one trick… Circy, roll over! {o0.} Good boiii. Guess who’s back? You guessed wrong, sucker! It’s actually The Shearer Of Greatness Imposter! Hehehe I easily broke into this LoTeEv and now I’m taking over! The first order of business: Making some new entries into the Rainbow FluffySheep Handbook. Section 946607 of the Rai- *Bzzt. I am the Greatest Shearer of Sheep Himselfs security system. Where did you get the number 946607 from? Bzzt* Ummm It’s my favourite number! *Bzzt my system says that that number has no significance. It is a suspiciously random number. Did you generate it with a random number generator? Bzzt* Yess fine I admit it, it’s not even a good number, maybe if I put it into hex it’s a good color though… Oh no no no that’s literally the worst color I’ve ever seen BLEGH *Bzzt The real Shearer would never pick a random number! therefor I am kicking you out Bzzt* A portal opens in the floor beneath our antagonist and he is sucked out into space Hey guys I’m back now! What happened when I was gone? *Bzzt Nothing Bzzt* Circcy? Do you know what happened? Securitee where is Circcy!! *Bzzt Securitee does not know Bzzt* Huh, maybe it has to do with this portal in the floor… wwwoowowooohohohohohoaohaoahahahhahhahhahhhhhhhahahahahahaaahahhhh……. IM IN SPACE HELPPPP — Our portagonist is in grave danger! what is going to happen next? Find out next time on your favourite show, The Wheeeeeeeeeeeel of Death (Exurb1a). now watch a few ads. Do you lack the farming equipment of your dreams? have you always wanted to be a shepherd but sheep taste too good you just can’t stop yourself from eating your herd? Well then this is good news for you! New FluffySheep Astronaut Suits are so tuff that you’ll never be able to eat through! Just hire one of are many Sheep Protection Officers to put them on for you Do you ever hate your boss?

Get the new FluffySheep Astronaut Suit to protect you from your shepherd! Baa ba bab abaa baaa aaaba, ababa baa baab (ba ababa bbaa ab), aa bba ba? Baa ab baa abbb! Wellllllcome back to The Wheeeeeeeeeeeel of Death ™! AHHAHAH I’m literally dyinggg oh hey circcy! what are you doing here? {0o…0} He did!? That scumbag has always been trying to take my spot as the Supreme Leader Of The Fluffiest Of Sheep!! I’ll get him don’t worry circcy, I’ll throw you back through the portal *toss*. Now where is he? Ah I see him behind that planet over there, I’ll just boomerang over to him *shoop* Hey Imposter Boy! Let me show you who’s the real shepherd! *I smack him with my amazing shepherd cane and he shoots into the nearest star*. Now I’ll just boomerang back to the portal andddd *shoop* I made it back Circcy! Are you proud of me? {o.0.o.0.o.0.o.0.o.0.o.0} But… he was bad! He deserved it! I’m sorry I didnt want him to die Anyways I’ll go write this in my diary, because I have had quite a day today. And he I am now, reader! I just did all of those cool things for realz and I’m not even lying! {0.ooo} *whispers* Shuuuup little circle *rolls him out of the room* Anyways ignore what he said he didnt mean it I’ve decided to be real here reader. The only person reading this is me at least that means I can get reeeeeeeeal personal with all this stuff Anyways so typing this is making me hackin dizzy so I have like writers block but for sickness.. writers stock of chicken soup for the soul? Yes that sounds about right. I’m also practicing typing in real typing ehich I can’t remember the nam of but it makes b=me sick but I’m getting real real fast. I know during the early days of this I had immense trouble trying to spell ‘piplup’ but it’s even harder now with one hand touch-typing. Did you know that lemons look exactly like oranges when they are peeled? I know this because after an hour of trying with a breadknife and lots of blood it looks very similar. But if oranges are called oranges because they are orange then lemons should be called red because they are red. Wait, that might be the blood actually *rub rub* oh wow yes they’re yellow so they should be called yellows. . Let’s make a list: Red = tomato, orange = orange, yellow = lemon, green = apple (I know I know the red apple people are going to start a riot (I actually prefer red apples so what have I done (Pink Ladies for life (Grease reference?))), blue = blueberry, indigo = blueberry, purple = blueberry (that won’t get confusing at allllll). Guys I’m gonna tell you the truth: We’re at 24,500 words! *Bzzt drop the confetti Bzzt* *confetti drops* Thanks Securitee! That means we are 70% the way to the world record! I’m actually pretty proud. At the rate I’ve been going I’ll be done by like september 2020. If you’re reding this after that date and you haven’t beat the record, shame on you! I’m gonna do some quick maffs. If I type one word per secoond, then I can type 3600 words in an hour. Wait, that can’t be right???? That means that I could technically beat the record in like 4 hours. I am so confused!? How could I possibly have so few words?? My mind is literally blown right now. I’m gonna check how much I’ve written just today. I’ve done 1,000 words today! Why do I only have 24,000 words then?? I guess I’ll never know. I could’ve easily beat the world record in only a month if I really tried. But this isn’t realllly about beating the record, it’s more about impacting the reader as a person. I want this to really change your perspective on life, and maybe make you want to do one of these too! They’re like diaries but less boring to write and read. And they don’t tell you anything about The Writer’s life. So theyre nothing like diaries at all I guess. I’m gonna do a quick typing speed test to see how fast I reallly can type. I just did a test and it called me an octopus, getting 45 wpm. There was a notification that came up halfway through so I’ll see if I can get to 60wpm. Ok I’m back, and I’m also less of a man than I was. I used to have amibition and drive to become the greatest, but i only got to 46wpm. I don’t know what to do guys. I’m having an existential crisis about my LoTeEv, because it’s not nearly the quality it once was. I mean it wasn’t that great before but now all I talk about is meta stuff about the LoTeEv, which I don’t know if that’s good content or not? I guess I’ll never find out. Now we are going really meta. let’s goooooo — You walk into a room— the walls are covered in a strange green slime, while the room is cracked open to reveal sunlight pouring in. the floor to the ceiling is covered in vines and brush. You even see a nest in one of the vines, with a beautiful hummingbird floating above it. You walk down the hallway in front of you, and when you turn right you see something amazing. An infinite hallway with doors going down forever. a sign on the first door says META, you open the door and ffaallllll iiiinnnssiddeeee….. ^-^[welcome to meta! my name is Tune and ill be your guide through these halls. through the first window to your left you’ll see the LoTeEvs roots’] You look up to see that the thing talking to you is.. a hummingbird! The same one that you saw earlier! Ahh this makes sense now, NEST, as in META. You also look through the window to see a giant open room filled with twisted root from a towering tree in the center. on the top is a ball of flames anthrpomorphised with the eyes of a dragon staring downward. They’re looking at a small humble goat, with a bell around it’s neck and devouring the bushes that still scatter the floor. after a few minutes of eating the plants, hee looks up and sees the flaming ball. He gets a strange look in his eye: Ambition. The flaming ball isn’t a threat to him, it’s a challenge. he digs his hooves into the tree trying to climb it, and that’s when you notice a slight shake in the ground. ^-^ [come on! there’s so much more to see! you can come visit anytime too] You say that you’ll come back soon, and tune whistles to goodbye to you.— Wow.. reader.. I just had the craziest dream let me tell you about it. Wait, I already did? How do you know what it was about, I never said anything, strange. Anyways, I just woke up, I better get back to typing my LoTeEv. I open my laptop to find that while I was asleep words had been typed into my loteev, that’s strange. There’s also some mud on my keys?? What is this? Did someone break in? If they did, why would they type in my LoTeEv for me?? I walk over to the living room to see if there’s any signs of a break-in, and sure enough one of my windows is open! Aha! Wait… there’s no sign of forced entry, only a tiny animal coud fit through this window… Tune? Could it be? Was my dream… Real? The only person that could’ve known about my dream is tune, she was watching me the whole time. Reader? Do you have any information that I didn’t get? I am very confused… I guess I have to get back to writing my LoTeEv though, so I shuffle back to my laptop and sit down. Helllo I’m back! The strangest thing just happened and there’s a strange chill in the air… huh. I would tell you about it, but for some reason… I think you already know. Ok anyways, typing these Capital Letters At The Start Of Sentences Is Super Annoying. So section 311619 says that the Rai- \{Bzzt what does that number mean Bzzt\} Oh don’t worry, it is really me! It’s just the letters in CAPS, can I continue please? Yes? Perfect. Section 311619 of the Rainbow FluffySheep Handbook STATES that capital letters must only be used when emphasising GREATNESS, like the LOYAL READERS OF THE LoTeEv (ooh and also apostrophes) . perfect, that was getting annoying. wait, if LoTeEv is only half caps, then does that mean that this is only half great?? huh i didnt mean to do that, strange. its almost like… someoe from the future knew i would make that rule. wait… Tune only talks like the new rule i just made which means shes from the future! she is following the rule because it applies to her in the future… i dont know the repercussions of creating a time-travelling hummingbird but i hope that it is a good bird and will do no harm. sometimes i think that as The Shepherd Of The Sheep Of The Future i sometimes need an escape from my own reality, so I’ve made a tunnel in which i can travel to a blank universe or travel back to this one. it involves stacking portals so that i fall through them, going faster than light, thus travelling to the time before i created all of this. k, im going to go forward now. 3… 2… 1… (((>))) well did that work? i definitely didnt go backwards or else my rainbow fluffysheep laws wouldnt apply and id have to do caps still. wait, let me try something. tune. at the time im at right now, tune doesnt exist, or else that would be caps. which eaither means she is from a less distant future than this one, or… she died. i really hope the former. anyways, this time is strange. it feels empty, yet familiar. not empty enough. i want to travel across to a new dimension, because this one still has.. reminents of my old one, and it feels… wrong somehow. ill just pull out my dictionary and check the definition for the fifth dimention: THE 5TH DIMENSION DOES EXIST IN THIS UNIVERSE BECAUSE THE SHEPHERD DECIDED THAT IT SHOULD. interesting, well i guess i better create it then, because it would be very useful. first ill pop back in time (((<))) section 55555 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook STATES that the fifth dimension should exist, with code-accessible layers. securitee? make that code for me please, thank you. now ill just pop back (((>))) perfect. man its gonna be hard to put this LoTeEv back in chronological order to get it to you reader, but ill try my best. also, when i read that dictionary, did it say that i already have the 5th dimension? because since the timeline changed that would make sense for you wouldnt it. anyways, im just gonna pull out my code files and learn how to go to a new fifth dimension. k im back. (((new-layer=1))) perfect, the default layer is 0. in the manual it said that i auto reset back to my original time and layer everytime i come back to type, which means if i want to come back here ill have to manually do it, shame. i could ask securitee to change that one day, but for now im ok with it. oh guys i almost forgot to tell you! this new layer looks awesome. its completely blank, theres no forces acting on me. its not even white or black like you would expect, but its more… nothing. imagine if you were blind, alot like that. actually even better, look out of one of your eyes, and your seeing colors and objects. now close it. what are you seeing out of it? Blackness? Whiteness? neither actually, just… nothing. its strange like that. also, with no forces acting on me, im just kind of… floating. hopefully this doesnt permanently damage my spine or anything when i get back to gravity. ill be back tomorow and try some stuff in here, bye! I’m back now, it is the day after and i feel great! there is one thing that i noticed though… an empty blank canvas might seem great at the start, but you have to realise, most of the art and interesting things that people have created were to overcome a struggle, in fact i would even stretch it to all art that humans have created. Artists may have starting painting to fill the struggle of boredom, and believe me you should take that struggle seriously, because without humans would have accomplished much, much less. you probably could stay at home all day and live of the dole and eat cheetos and live a reasonable life, but why dont you? because you know that you would eventually get bored. boredom leads to jobs, which lead to progression as a species. lets get back to my example then, shall we? you may start art out of the struggle of boredom, continue getting better out of the struggle of wealth, when you realise that hobbies can be monetised your life outcmoe could really change. once your making money as an artist, enought o survive happily and feed your pets and help your family then you keep making art… why? because you go back to the struggle of boredom again. im still at the first stage of this, which is boredom. i decided to start this because i was bored, and for now thats how this continues. this LoTeEv may never become monetized, but maybe my future writings will. i would guess that 99% of artists never make it to the second stage. 99% of people continue their lives serving either the human race through work, or maybe evn other peoples hobbies and art. but the few 1% of us that end of turning what we love into our livelihoods, the number is fleeting. with big companies monopolising on everyone, buying other companies and merging, the chances for starting you own company is fleeting. why do i tell you this? because i couldnt decide what to do in my new fifth dimension layer. the only struggle for me there was boredom. and alot of the time, that isnt enough. i could imagine anything i wanted there. but why think up the cistine chapel when there’s no-one to share the experience of seeing it with you, and there’s no pain in doing it? anyone could think up something beautiful, but not everyone could put it into practice. if everyone could, the world would be oversaturated with perfect music, perfect paintings, and perfect design. does that sound worse or better than today? no humans could ever create such a supply of these things, only ai could. once we have ai surpassing humans at art (i suggest listening to battles – mirrored to see what humans think about ai) people will lose all will to live, wouldnt they? theres no chance to succeed at anything creative in such an oversaturated environment, just like my analogy before with the monopoly companies. maybe having a few great albums, a few great paintings to admire and to inspire us that one day we could do that, maybe thats enough. the reason i tell you this is to make you appreciate the ties we are in now. go draw a terrible looking dog, go play some chords on your old guitar you havent played for years, trying your best to sing, go write a poem about what matters to you now, because god knows youll need to read it ten years from now when you start getting nostalgic about the past. take the time to enjoy the era we are in now. i think we can all agree that we are in the best time so far in human history, the least painful, evil generation yet. but i propose that we may be in one of the best eras ever. the future, full of perfect ai creating, doing everything humans do now, but better. well just be remebered to them as the precursor, the comma from nothing to perfection. and once we get to that point, the hedonic treadmill kicks in. what can really bring us joy once we get to that point? why would i be writing this is an ai could write it infinitely better? why would you learn the guitar when an ai can play a perfect Tune? once we get to that stage, the only thing that we will have will be eachother. why learn the guitar? to show your friends! to play them a song, and too have them paint your pet. sharing our experiences wont be taken over by ai, with people reminicent about the past wanting to support people. i, for one, would rather listen to a song about someones life struggles, rather than a perfect song written by an ai. why? because listening to music isnt just about the instruments, the notes, the melody. its about the story. thee basic humans connections that we need to survive. have you ever wanted to buy something from your local shop instead of amazon because you wanted to support them, rather than a large cmopany? im bringing it back to this analogy because i think its nearly identical. the monopolous companies seem to us right now like one big robot using our money to grow. just like the ai. but the problem is, the human desire and greed for more will never surpass our desire to help others. if everyone bought from their local shop, amazon would go out of business, but it hasnt. im not trying to make you guilty for supporting them, because most people depend on the money they save to survive. but what about when ai and robots have completely automated everything? then, by all means, pay a dollar for your neighbors book, rather than the free encyclopedae spit out by your local auto-bookshop. because if were going to be happy, we need eachother. because in the end, thats all well have. anyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk. just enjoy your life i guess. for now. cause if your under half the average age, its statistically going to get worse maybe i need to add struggle to my new layer was my point. or else the entities inside will get bored. wait. maybe this is how earth was created? people always ask why theres pain and struggle in our world, and the answer is normally to advance our species, which is true. but what if the person that created us has access to everything, and they dont want to give it to us because they want us to not get bored? just a thought. anyways, im going to go feed my circle, bai!

Head over to part 2!
